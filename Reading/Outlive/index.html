Together, they account for the vast majority of deaths. Reducing your risk for all 4 should massively extend your lifespan and healthspan.</p><blockquote><p>Four Horsemen: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, or type 2 diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction.</p></blockquote><p>After reading this book, you realise how much suffering you could mitigate by learning and implementing simple practices to improve your health.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Avoidable human misery is more often caused not so much by stupidity as by ignorance, particularly our ignorance about ourselves.&rdquo; â€” Carl Sagan.</p></blockquote><a href=#caloric-restriction><h2 id=caloric-restriction><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Caloric Restriction</h2></a><p>There is an interesting molecule, rapamycin, that is the only molecule ever shown to extend lifespan of mammals. The effect has been reproduced by many researchers in many environments on many animals, all showing a consistent effect of lifespan extension.</p><blockquote><p>The reason rapamycin has so many diverse applications is thanks to a property that Sehgal had observed, but never explored, which is that it tends to slow down the process of cellular growth and division.</p></blockquote><p>The reasoning behind why rapamycin extends life is that it interacts with <strong>mTOR</strong> which is a protein complex that basically syncs the availability of nutrients and cell division. Abundant food â†’ mTOR drives cell division. Food scarce â†’ mTOR slows cell division.</p><blockquote><p>rapamycin acted directly on a very important intracellular protein complex called mTOR. The job of mTOR is basically to balance an organism&rsquo;s need to grow and reproduce against the availability of nutrients. When food is plentiful, mTOR is activated and the cell (or the organism) goes into growth mode, producing new proteins and undergoing cell division, as with the ultimate goal of reproduction. When nutrients are scarce, mTOR is suppressed and cells go into a kind of &ldquo;recycling&rdquo; mode, breaking down cellular components and generally cleaning house.</p></blockquote><p>The deprivation of nutrients (i.e. eating less) has been historically observed to extend life.</p><blockquote><p>This idea goes all the way back to Hippocrates, but more modern experiments have demonstrated, over and over, that reducing the food intake of lab animals could lengthen their lives.</p></blockquote><p>The lifespan extension from caloric restriction is quite significant. In mice, it could extend lifespan by â‰¥ 15%.</p><blockquote><p>The results have been remarkably consistent. Studies dating back to the 1930s have found that limiting caloric intake can lengthen the lifespan of a mouse or a rat by anywhere from 15 to 45%, depending on the age of onset and degree of restriction. Not only that, but the underfed animals also seem to be markedly healthier for their age, developing fewer spontaneous tumours than normally fed mice.</p></blockquote><a href=#insulin><h2 id=insulin><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Insulin</h2></a><p>When glucose is absorbed into our bloodstream after digestion, special cells in the pancreas known as pancreatic beta cells which have special glucose transporter proteins in its membrane that can pull in glucose, then trigger a corresponding release of <strong>insulin</strong> into the bloodstream. Insulin reaches pretty much every cell in the body which have special receptors on its membrane to detect insulin. Different kinds of cells respond differently to insulin:</p><ul><li>Muscle cells â€” pull in more glucose to fuel muscle contraction.</li><li>Fat cells â€” store more glucose as fat.</li><li>Liver cells â€” store more glycogen.</li><li>Brain neurons â€” tune down appetite, and other things.</li></ul><p>If there is excess glucose in our bloodstream after digestion, the liver will eventually convert a fraction of that glucose to <strong>glycogen</strong> through a process called <strong>glycogenesis</strong>. Glycogen is essentially a polymer of glucose. The process of breaking glycogen down back to individual glucose molecules is called <strong>glycogenolysis</strong>. Enzymes are responsible for driving these processes.</p><blockquote><p>One of the liver&rsquo;s many important jobs is to convert glycogen back to glucose and then release it as needed to maintain blood glucose levels at a steady state, known as <strong>glucose homeostasis</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Glycogen looks like this: it&rsquo;s a bunch of glucose molecules, branching out from a central enzyme called <strong>glycogenin</strong>. This is a cross-sectional view:
<img src=/Reading/assets/glycogen-molecular-structure.png width=400></p><p>If there is so much glucose that it exceeds what can be reasonably stored as glycogen, then the liver converts the <em>glucose to fatty acids</em> through a process called <strong>lipogenesis</strong>. Your fat cells are also capable of executing lipogenesis. Once fatty acids are produced, they combine with a glycerol molecule to form a <strong>triglyceride</strong> molecule.

<a href=https://ib.bioninja.com.au/standard-level/topic-2-molecular-biology/23-carbohydrates-and-lipids/triglycerides.html rel=noopener>source</a>)</p><p>Triglycerides then get transported by <strong>lipoproteins</strong> where they get carried to various tissues in the body to be deposited as fat for long-term storage.</p><p>Fat can be stored in two ways: as <strong>subcutaneous fat</strong> (right under your skin, above your muscle tissue) and as <strong>visceral fat</strong> (surrounding your organs, like your liver, intestines, etc. which is not visible externally). We strongly prefer gaining subcutaneous fat over visceral fat, because visceral fat is associated with heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, etc. Genetics play a big role in determining how much fat is stored as visceral fat. Notably, cortisol shifts fat over to visceral.</p><blockquote><p>Cortisol is especially potent, with a double-edged effect of depleting subcutaneous fat (which is generally beneficial) and replacing it with more harmful visceral fat. This is one reason why stress levels and sleep, both of which affect cortisol release, are pertinent to metabolism.</p></blockquote><p>Fructose is treated differently by the body. It happens to be much easier for it to be stored as fat. It&rsquo;s not concerning to eat fruit in general though because the fiber buffers the release of fructose into the bloodstream. Drinking fruit juice directly can contribute to your risk of NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease).</p><blockquote><p>It is very difficult to get fat from eating too many apples, for example, because the fructose in the apple enters our system relatively slowly, mixed with fiber and water, and our gut and out metabolism can handle it normally.</p></blockquote><a href=#atherosclerosis><h2 id=atherosclerosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Atherosclerosis</h2></a><p>Lipids like cholesterol and triglycerides can&rsquo;t be transported in the blood directly because it&rsquo;s not soluble in blood plasma. Instead it&rsquo;s encapsulated in a lipoprotein, which is a structure made of a phospholipid shell, that <em>can</em> be transported in blood. Inside that shell, we have triglycerides and cholesterol.
<img src=/Reading/assets/lipoprotein-structure.png width=400></p><p>Apolipoprotein B is the main biomarker that (almost certainly) has a causal effect with atherosclerosis. LDL cholesterol carries apoB.</p><blockquote><p>Each lipoprotein particle is enwrapped by one or more large molecules, called apolipoproteins, that provide structure, stability, and, most importantly solubility to the particle. <strong>HDL</strong> particles are wrapped in a type of molecule called apolipoprotein A (apoA), while <strong>LDL</strong> is encased in apolipoprotein B (apoB)&mldr; every sinlge lipoprotein that contributes to atherosclerosis â€” not only LDL but several others â€” carries this apoB protein signature.</p></blockquote><p>Note that cholesterol is an essential molecule in <em>every cell</em> of your body. It&rsquo;s something you need, and your liver is capable of synthesising it. What makes cholesterol harmful is the unfortunate tendency for lipoproteins carrying apoB to get stuck in your arterial walls, forming large deposits that eventually turn into calcium plaque which can rupture and clog your arteries. Lipoproteins carrying apoA however can pass through the blood vessel wall to reach cells without issue.</p><p>Your apoB levels are measurable in a blood test.</p><p>It&rsquo;s generally widely accepted now that <em>dietary cholesterol</em>, meaning direct ingestion of cholesterol molecules, does not actually contribute to increased blood cholesterol.</p><blockquote><p>The vast majority of the cholesterol in our circulation is actually produced by our own cells. Nevertheless, US dietary guidelines warned Americans away from consuming foods high in cholesterol for decades.</p></blockquote><p>Saturated fats, however, do directly contribute to increased LDL cholesterol in two ways:</p><ol><li>It signals to the liver to pump out more LDL cholesterol.</li><li>It dampens the LDL cholesterol receptors in the liver cells thereby reducing the clearance of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.</li></ol><blockquote><p>First, it seems saturated fat contributes directly to the synthesis of excess cholesterol. Second, and more importantly, excess saturated fat causes the liver to reduce expression of LDL receptors, thereby reducing the amount of LDL removed from circulation.</p></blockquote><a href=#cancer><h2 id=cancer><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Cancer</h2></a><a href=#exerise><h2 id=exerise><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Exerise</h2></a><blockquote><p>Exercise is by far the most potent longevity &ldquo;drug&rdquo;.
