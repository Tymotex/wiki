Kale smoothie seems really good.</li><li>Broccoli and cruciferous vegetables in general.</li><li>Turmeric for curcumin.</li><li>Oatmeal (for fibre).</li><li>Berries.</li><li>Nuts, seeds and grains.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Our diet is the number-one cause of premature death and the number-one cause of disability.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&mldr; <strong>the science shows that our genes often account for only 10-20% of risk at most</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>The incentive structure for healthcare rewards the treatment of symptoms and lessening of pain through drugs and surgery rather than through the treatment of root causes or preventative treatment through diet and exercise. Due to that, the revolutionary findings of the effects of diet and exercise have failed to propagate effectively through society, and health professionals rarely have adequate training in nutrition.</p><blockquote><p>After Dr. Ornish proved that heart disease could be reversed without drugs or surgery, he thought that his studies would have a meaningful effect on the practice of mainstream medicine. After all, he effectively found a cure for our number-one killer! But he was mistaken, not about his critically important findings regarding diet and disease reversal but about <strong>how much influence the business of medicine has on the practice of medicine</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>The author strongly encourages whole-food plant-based diets, claiming it to the be the type of diet that seems to reliably reduce risks of disease in studies.</p><blockquote><p>&mldr; healthy eating may be &ldquo;best achieved with a plant-based diet, which we define as a regimen that encourages whole, plant-based foods and discourages meats, dairy products, and eggs as well as all refined and processed foods&rdquo;</p></blockquote><a href=#cardiac-health><h2 id=cardiac-health><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Cardiac Health</h2></a><p>There is a claim in the book that fish and fish oil supplements do not improve cardiac health:</p><blockquote><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at all the best randomised clinical trials evaluating the effects of omega-3 fats on life span, cardiac death, sudden death, heart attack, and stroke&mldr; Overall, the researchers found <strong>no protective benefit</strong> for overall mortality, heart disease mortality, sudden cardiac death, heart attack, or stroke.</p></blockquote><p>High LDL cholesterol levels are said to be the main cause of coronary heart disease.</p><blockquote><p>To drastically reduce LDL cholesterol levels, you need to drastically reduce your intake of 3 things: trans fat, which comes from processed foods and naturally from meat and dairy; saturated fat, found mainly in animal products and junk foods; and to a lesser extent dietary cholesterol, found exclusively in animal-derived foods, especially eggs.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>An LDL around 70 mg/dL corresponds to a total cholesterol reading of about 150 mg/dL, the level below which no deaths from coronary heart disease were reported in the famous Framingham Heart Study&mldr; To become virtually heart-attack proof, <strong>you need to get your LDL cholesterol at least under 70 mg/dL</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Statins are praised for lowering LDL cholesterol, however there are a number of negative health impacts. Some research shows it makes you more likely to have diabetes and invasive breast cancer.</p><blockquote><p>Plant-based diets have been shown to lower cholesterol just as effectively as first-line statin drugs, but without the risks.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Certain foods, such as meats, appear to harbour bacteria that can trigger inflammation dead or alive, even when the food is fully cooked. Endotoxins are not destroyed by cooking temperatures, stomach acid, or digestive enzymes, so after a meal of animal products, these endotoxins may end up in your intestines&mldr; ferried by saturated fat across the gut wall into your bloodstream, where they can trigger the inflammatory reaction in your arteries.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Dr. Ornish reported a 91% reduction in angina attacks within just a few weeks in patients placed on a plant-based diet both with or without exercise.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&mldr; just a single serving of 4 Brazil nuts almost immediately improved cholesterol levels. LDL cholesterol levels were a staggering 20 points lower just 9 hours after eating the Brazil nuts. Even drugs don&rsquo;t work nearly that fast.</p></blockquote><p>A caveat is that Brazil nuts are incredibly high in selenium, pushing you to the daily limit very quickly.</p><p>Kale is also incredibly effective at lowering LDL and increasing HDL cholesterol.</p><blockquote><p>Researchers took 30 men with high cholesterol and had them consume 3 to 4 shots of kale juice a day for 3 months&mldr;. What the kale did do was substantially lower their bad (LDL) cholesterol and boost their good (HDL) cholesterol as much as running 300 miles.</p></blockquote><a href=#lung-health><h2 id=lung-health><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lung Health</h2></a><p>Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, seem to aid substantially in fighting and prevent cancer.</p><blockquote><p>Compared to broccoli-avoiding smokers, the broccoli-eating smokers suffered 41% fewer DNA mutations in their bloodstream over 10 days.</p></blockquote><p>In a petri dish of lung cancer cells, exposure to cruciferous vegetables stunted cancer creep.</p><p>An experiment involved comparing the DNA mutations on bacteria caused by the carcinogens present in the urine of smokers and non-smokers. Interestingly, the curcumin pigment present in turmeric was helpful in reducing DNA mutation rates in smokers.</p><blockquote><p>Unsurprisingly, scientists who tried this experiment found that the urine from non-smokers caused far fewer DNA mutations&mldr; But when the smokers were given turmeric, the DNA-mutation rate dropped by up to 38%&mldr; They merely got less than a teaspoon a day of just the regular turmeric spice you&rsquo;d find at the grocery store.</p></blockquote><p>A large portion of the non-smokers that develop lung cancer can be attributed to second-hand smoke and to frying fumes.</p><blockquote><p>When fat is heated to frying temperatures, whether it be animal fat, such as lard, or plant fat, such as vegetable oil, toxic volatile chemicals with mutagenic properties (those able to cause genetic mutations) are released into the air. <strong>This happens even before the the smoke point temperature is reached</strong>. If you do fry at home, <strong>good ventilation</strong> in the kitchen may reduce lung cancer risk.</p></blockquote><p>The grilling of meat can release polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which has been shown to reduce the birth weight and head size of babies when their mother has been exposed to them. The harmful effect of high PAH levels have led to researchers advocating against living near the exhaust of restaurants (especially Chinese restaurants which frequently pan fry fish).</p><p>Cooking bacon releases a carcinogenic fume containing nitrosamines.</p><blockquote><p>If you do need to be around frying bacon or eggs, it would be safer to limit your exposure by using a backyard grill. Studies show that the number of particles deposited into the lungs increases by a factor of 10 when frying indoors versus outdoors.</p></blockquote><a href=#brain-health><h2 id=brain-health><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Brain Health</h2></a><blockquote><p>The 2 most serious brain diseases are stroke, which kills nearly 130000 Americans each year, and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, which kills nearly 85000.</p></blockquote><p>Fibre is incredibly useful for reducing risks towards cancers and diseases.</p><blockquote><p>In addition to its well-known effects on bowel health, high fibre intake appears to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon and breast, diabetes, heart diseases, obesity, and premature death in general. A number of studies now show that high fibre intake may also help ward off stroke.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&mldr; fibre helps control your cholesterol and blood sugar levels, which can help reduce the amount of artery-clogging plaque in your brain&rsquo;s blood vessels.</p></blockquote><p>Cholesterol is not only a primary risk factor for heart disease, it is also a huge contributor to the risk of Alzheimer&rsquo;s:</p><blockquote><p>&mldr; autopsies have demonstrated that Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients had particularly significant arterial blockage in he arteries leading to the memory centres of their brains. In light of such findings, some experts have even suggested that Alzheimer&rsquo;s be reclassified as a vascular disorder&mldr; Too much cholesterol in your blood&mldr; is unanimously recognised as a risk factor for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Under an electron microscope, we can see the clustering of amyloid fibres on and around tiny crystals of cholesterol. And indeed, advanced brain imaging techniques, such as PET scans, have shown a direct correlation between the amount of LDL cholesterol in the blood and amyloid buildup in the brain.</p></blockquote><p>Berries (due to their polyphenols) have been shown to reduce cognitive decline in older adults.</p><blockquote><p>in 2012&mldr; the diets and health of 16000 women were followed starting i 1980. They found that women who consumed at least one serving of blueberries and 2 servings of strawberries each week had slower rates of cognitive decline, by as much as two and a half years, compared with those who didn&rsquo;t eat berries.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Beyond their antioxidant activity, polyphenols have been shown to protect nerve cells in vitro by inhibiting the formation of the plaques and tangles that characterise Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p></blockquote><p>AGEs (advanced glycation end products), thought to accelerate aging exist in greatest amounts in meat, dairy, processed foods. They&rsquo;re formed when fat and protein are subjected to high temperatures.</p><blockquote><p>The researchers recommend cooking meat using moist-heat cooking methods, such as steaming or stewing, but even boiled fish has more than 10 times more AGEs than a sweet potato roasted for an hour.</p></blockquote><p>Exercise has been shown to reverse shrinkage of brain volume caused by aging and neurodegenerative disease:</p><blockquote><p>Subsequent studies using MRI scans found that aerobic exercise can actually reverse age-related shrinkage in the memory centers of the brain.</p></blockquote><a href=#digestive-health><h2 id=digestive-health><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Digestive Health</h2></a><p>Phytates, a stored form of phosphorus found in seeds, nuts, grains, legumes, were shown to be effective at suppressing cancer:</p><blockquote><p>Petri-dish studies have shown that phytates inhibit the growth of virtually all human cancer cells tested so far, including cancers of the colon, breast, cervix, prostate, liver pancreas, and skin, while leaving normal cells alone.</p></blockquote><p>The NIH-AARP study following 545000 men and women made the following conclusion:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Meat consumption was associated with increased risk of dying from cancer, dying from heart disease, and dying prematurely in general</strong>. Again, this was after controlling for other diet and lifestyle factors, effectively excluding the possibility that people who ate meat also smoked more, exercised less, or failed to eat their fruits and veggies.</p></blockquote><p>Heme iron (sourced from meat) is suspected as a significant contributor to cancer rates. Non-heme iron (sourced from plants) is less likely to push your body to a dangerous surplus.</p><blockquote><p>&mldr; iron can generate cancer-causing free radicals by acting as a pro-oxidant&mldr; The human body has no specific mechanism to rid itself of excess iron.</p></blockquote><p>Fibre seems to solve many problems:</p><blockquote><p>Our bodies were designed to expect an every-flowing fibre stream, so it dumps such unwanted waste products as excess cholesterol and estrogen into the intestines assuming they will be swept away&mldr; Only 3% of Americans may even reach the recommended <em>minimum</em> daily intake of fibre.</p></blockquote><a href=#infections><h2 id=infections><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Infections</h2></a><p>Blueberries increase the number of natural killer cells.</p><blockquote><p>In one study researchers asked athletes to eat about a cup and a half of blueberries every day for six weeks to see if the berries could reduce the oxidative stress caused by long-distance running. The blueberries succeeded, unsurprisingly, but a more important finding was their effect on natural killer cells&mldr; consuming blueberries actually doubled their killer cell counts, to more than 4 billion.</p></blockquote><p>The massive amounts of antibiotics fed to animals are inevitably passed to us, resulting in antibiotic-resistant pathogens</p><blockquote><p>In the U.S., meat producers feed millions of pounds of antibiotics each year to farm animals just to promote growth or prevent disease in the often cramped, stressful, and unhygienic conditions of industrial animal agriculture.</p></blockquote><p>Pathogens originating from animals such as E. coli, salmonella, C. diff are far more challenging to kill on kitchen surfaces and through cooking than we thought.</p><a href=#diabetes><h2 id=diabetes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Diabetes</h2></a><blockquote><p>More than 20 million Americans are currently diagnosed with diabetes, a tripling of cases since 1990. At this rate, the CDC predicts that 1 in 3 Americans will be diabetic by midcentury.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Interestingly, the number of individual fat cells in your body doesn&rsquo;t change much in adulthood, no matter how much weight you gain or lose. They just swell up with fat as the body gains weight, so when your belly gets bigger, you&rsquo;re not necessarily creating new fat cells; rather, you&rsquo;re just cramming more fat into existing ones.</p></blockquote><a href=#blood-pressure><h2 id=blood-pressure><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Blood Pressure</h2></a><blockquote><p>The number-one risk factor for death in the world they identified is high blood pressure. Also known as hypertension, high blood pressure lays waste to 9 million people worldwide every year.</p></blockquote></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/Reading/Reading/ data-ctx="How to Not Die" data-src=/Reading/Reading class=internal-link>Reading</a></li></ul></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://timz.dev>timz.dev</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/Tymotex/wiki>Github</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/timz-seng>LinkedIn</a></li></ul><p>Tim Zhang Â© 2022</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
