Be bold and learn things that you dislike or are fearful of such as sales, negotiation, public speaking, leadership, etc. Collect assets and minimise accumulating liabilities and you&rsquo;ll be wealthy. This book gives me even greater confidence in the value of ruthlessly learning a little about everything and confirms the idea that knowledge (or time and attention, two expensive inputs to attaining knowledge) is the greatest asset I possess.</p><p>Constantly look and read about new approaches to investing that you&rsquo;ve never considered or have much knowledge in.</p><p>ðŸ’Ž <strong>Wealth is not a measure of money</strong>, but rather the capacity to enjoy life to the fullest. Put concretely, it can be interpreted as the number of days you can live if you were to completely cease working.</p><p>ðŸ’Ž Just collect assets and minimise accruing liabilities.</p><p>ðŸ’Ž Your knowledge is the greatest wealth vehicle.</p><p>ðŸ’Ž Always strive to learn a little about a lot, to constantly pick up new skills (especially in areas that frighten you such as sales and public speaking) and be bolder than everyone else.</p><p>TODO: You should go do something bold, eg. take a course in negotiation, go to Toastmasters, do <em>something</em> that scares you.</p><p>TODO: investing knowledge should be something you <em>really</em> focus on improving this year. It&rsquo;s worth it, just as much as software engineering is.</p><hr><blockquote><p>Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial education. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Just know that it&rsquo;s fear that keeps most people working at a job: the fear of not paying their bills, the fear of being fired, the fear of not having enough money, and the fear of starting over.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>People&rsquo;s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and greed.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you don&rsquo;t first handle fear and desire, and you get rich, you&rsquo;ll only be a highly paid slave.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We will always have emotions of fear and greed&mldr; it&rsquo;s imperative for you to use those emotions to your advantage, and for the long term to not let your emotions control your thinking.</p></blockquote><p>Fear and greed drive the vicious cycle known as the <em>rat race</em>. More money doesn&rsquo;t solve life&rsquo;s problems, and it can exacerbate it.</p><blockquote><p>Rule #1: You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets.</p></blockquote><p>To be rich, spend on assets, minimise spending on liabilities. That&rsquo;s it. Assets include stocks, bonds, real estate, notes, and any other revenue-generating thing.</p><blockquote><p>Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not liabilities.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Think of it this way: Once a dollar goes into your asset column, it becomes your employee.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The greatest losses of all are those from missed opportunities. If all your money is tied up in your house, you may be forced to work harder because your money continues blowing out of the expense column, instead of adding to the asset column â€” the classic middle-class cash-flow pattern.</p></blockquote><p>^Kiyosaki talking about your home as an investment.</p><blockquote><p>When I want a bigger house, I first buy assets that will generate the cash flow to pay for the house.</p></blockquote><p>The 4 pillars of &lsquo;financial IQ&rsquo; are:</p><ol><li>Accounting</li><li>Investing</li><li>Understanding markets</li><li>Law (for exploiting tax advantages, especially as a corporation).</li></ol><p>Many people are &ldquo;one skill away from great wealth&rdquo;.</p><blockquote><p>The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind. If it is trained well, it can create enormous wealth.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>The most important specialised skills are sales and marketing</strong>. The ability to sell â€” to communicate to another human being, be it a customer, employee, boss, spouse, or child â€” is the base skill of personal success. <strong>Communications skills such as writing, speaking, and negotiating are crucial to a life of success</strong>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I know of no other skills to be more important than selling and marketing. The skills of selling and marketing are difficult for most people, primarily due to their fear of rejection.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Failure inspires winners. And failure defeats losers.</p></blockquote><p>The most common form of laziness is &ldquo;laziness by staying busy.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>Many rich families lose their assets in the next generation simply because there was no one trained to be a good steward over their assets.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Most people simply buy investments rather than first investing <em>in learning about investing</em>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I am always shocked at people who buy stocks or real estate, but never invest in their greatest asset, their mind.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I would say that one of the hardest things about wealth-building is to be true to yourself and to be willing to not go along with the crowd. This is because, in the market, it is usually the crowd that shows up late that is slaughtered. If a great deal is on the front page, it&rsquo;s too late in most instances. Look for a new deal.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In today&rsquo;s fast-changing world, it&rsquo;s not so much what you know anymore that counts, because often what you know is old. <strong>It is how fast you learn</strong>. That skill is priceless.</p></blockquote><p>An idea originating from <em>The Richest Man in Babylon</em> is &lsquo;paying yourself first&rsquo;. This means then when you have the funds to choose to either spend the money on investments or paying the bills, spend the money on investments. This takes discipline because there is pressure in avoiding paying bills late, but Kiyosaki argues that this drives you to be financially intelligent and come up with ways to make it work.</p><blockquote><p>Copying or emulating heroes is true power learning.</p></blockquote><p>You should have heroes that shape your identity in the way you want. Eg. Kiyosaki mentions idolising people such as Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch.</p><blockquote><p>When I&rsquo;m in the market or I&rsquo;m negotiating a deal, I am subconsciously acting with the bravado of Trump. Or when analysing a trend, I look at it as though Warren Buffet were doing it. <strong>By having heroes, we tap into a tremendous source of raw genius</strong>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When he was short of money, he gave money to his church or to his favourite charity. If I could leave one single idea with you, it is that idea. Whenever you feel short or in need of something, give what you want first and it will come back in buckets. That is true for money, a smile, love, or friendship.</p></blockquote><p>Always be a giving person. Recall in <a class="internal-link broken">Man&rsquo;s Search For Meaning</a>, the prisoners who were most resilient and likely to survive were the ones who gave away their last piece of bread.</p><blockquote><p>Find someone who has done what you want to do. Take them to lunch and ask hem for tips and tricks of the trade.</p></blockquote><p>Kiyosaki notes that he regularly looks for multi-day seminars to attend and commits to going to a few of them each year.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://timz.dev>timz.dev</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/Tymotex/wiki>Github</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/timz-seng>LinkedIn</a></li></ul><p>Tim Zhang Â© 2022</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
