Always be a good man and live by your own principles, independently of external influences.</p><p>ðŸ’Ž Suffering is omnipresent and unavoidable, but when framed in a meaningful context, you become unbreakable and can turn enduring your predicament into a triumph.</p><p>ðŸ’Ž <em>Meaningful suffering</em> is integral to mental well-being.</p><p>ðŸ’Ž Love is the highest goal to which you can aspire and along with meaningful work, is another source of strength to draw upon in your endurance of extreme suffering.</p><blockquote><p>(From the preface) For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; <em>it must ensue</em>, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one&rsquo;s dedication to a cause greater than oneself.</p></blockquote><hr><a href=#suffering><h2 id=suffering><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Suffering</h2></a><p>Suffering is constant and unavoidable. Like a gas expanding to fill a chamber, suffering expands to fill your conscious mind. Happiness is relative to your current conditions and can be manifested in spite of extreme suffering.</p><blockquote><p>Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death, human life cannot be complete.</p></blockquote><p>To face the entirety of your suffering despite your fear and laugh at the absurdity of it all diminishes and detaches you from suffering.</p><blockquote><p>Humour was another of the soul&rsquo;s weapons in the fight for self-preservation. It is well known that humour, more than anything else in the human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The attempt to develop a sense of humour and to see things in a humourous light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living.</p></blockquote><p><strong>You must see your suffering as a means to some end</strong>. You must always have some future end in mind to anchor your perception of your suffering â€” to put all the pain you go through into a context that is deeply meaningful to you. When you accomplish that, your suffering is something that empowers you and bolsters an unbreakable will.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.&rdquo; â€” Spinoza</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or one could ignore the challenge and simply vegetate, as did a majority of the prisoners.</p></blockquote><p>One interesting observation is that statistically, more prisoners died around the end of the year, near Christmas, than at other times throughout the year. The reason is simply the depressing disappointment of having been through another year without being liberated. Not having an end in sight to the suffering, or at least the hope and belief in an end, is itself one of the major causes of suffering.</p><blockquote><p>&mldr; it was the limitlessness of the term of imprisonment which was most acutely felt.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Those who know how close the connection is between the state of mind of a man â€” his courage and hope, or lack of them â€” and the state of immunity of his body will understand that the sudden loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect.</p></blockquote><p>You must have strong faith in your <em>why</em>, else you become apathetic.</p><blockquote><p>The prisoner who had lost faith in the future â€” his future â€” was doomed. With his loss of belief in the future, he also lost his spiritual hold; he let himself decline and became subject to mental and physical decay.</p></blockquote><p>You should be willing to fully experience suffering, proudly even, when the purpose of it becomes clear to you. When the true meaning of the suffering is ascertained and you trust in it with every fibre of your being, your will becomes unbreakable and you no scramble to avoid torture.</p><blockquote><p>&mldr; someone looks down on each of us in difficult hours â€” a friend, a wife, somebody alive or dead, or a God â€” and he would not expect us to disappoint him. He would hope to find us <strong>suffering proudly</strong> â€” not miserably â€” knowing how to die.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Once the meaning of suffering had been revealed to us, we refused to minimise or alleviate the camp&rsquo;s tortures by ignore them or harbouring false illusions and entertaining artificial optimism.</p></blockquote><p>Even when liberated, the prisoners were not suddenly overcome with joy. In fact, those who for which &lsquo;<em>life didn&rsquo;t expect much from</em>&rsquo; resumed their apathy and resentment. You must always have something to look forward to â€” whether it be a loved one whose embrace you yearn for, or an unfinished piece of work, or a passion project, or charitable work.</p><blockquote><p>Researchers at the Yale University School of Medicine &ldquo;have been impressed by the number of prisoners of war of the Vietnam war who explicitly claimed that although their captivity was extraordinarily stressful â€” filled with torture, disease, malnutrition, and solitary confinement â€” they nevertheless&mldr; benefited from the captivity experience, seeing it as a growth experience.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><a href=#love><h2 id=love><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Love</h2></a><p>The most beautiful passage I&rsquo;ve ever read on love:</p><blockquote><p>And as we stumbled on for miles, slipping on icy spots, supporting each other time and again, dragging one another up and onward, nothing was said, but we both knew: each of us was thinking of his wife. Occasionally I looked at the sky, where the stars were fading and the pink light of the morning was beginning to spread behind a dark bank of clouds. But my mind clung to my wife&rsquo;s image, imagining it with an uncanny acuteness. I heard her answering me, saw her smile, her frank and encouraging look. Real or not, her look was then more luminous than the sun which was beginning to rise. A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth â€” that <strong>love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire</strong>. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: <em>The salvation of man is through love and in love</em>. <strong>I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved</strong>. In a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way â€” and honourable way â€” in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfilment. For the first time in my life I was able to understand the meaning of the words, &ldquo;The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Once, an elderly general practitioner consulted me because of his severe depression. He could not overcome the loss of his wife who had died two years before and whom he had loved above all else. Now, how could I help him? What should I tell him? Well, I refined from telling him anything but instead confronted him with the question, &ldquo;What would have happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;for her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!&rdquo; Whereupon I replied, &ldquo;You see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it was you who have spared her this suffering â€” to be sure, at the price that now you have to survive and mourn her.&rdquo; He said no word but shook my hand and calmly left my office. <strong>In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice</strong>.</p></blockquote><a href=#good-and-evil><h2 id=good-and-evil><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Good and Evil</h2></a><p>In conditions of extreme suffering, people polarise towards their virtues and vices. We&rsquo;d like to believe we&rsquo;re all decent people with a strong character, values and morals, however you should never cast judgement on anyone else for the way they are. You too have it in you to be a monster.</p><blockquote><p>No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.</p></blockquote><p>It is possible, even under the most hellish conditions, to be a good man. All things in life can be taken from you, apart from your ability to abide by your own principles â€” the last of human freedoms.</p><blockquote><p>We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: <strong>the last of the human freedoms - to choose one&rsquo;s attitude in any given set of circumstances</strong>, to choose one&rsquo;s own way.</p></blockquote><p>You always have the capacity to choose what to do, or at least how to think. It is making the difficult and courageous decision to unconditionally abide by your principles which represents the greatest of triumphs, especially when you suffer for it.</p><blockquote><p>And there were always choices to make. Every day, every hour, offered the opportunity to make a decision, a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determined whether or not you would become the plaything of circumstance, renouncing freedom and dignity to become moulded into the form of the typical inmate.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It is this spiritual freedom, which cannot be taken away, that makes life meaningful and purposeful.</p></blockquote><p>External influences do nothing to determine what kind of person you become, it simply polarises you towards your vices or virtues. Even being subjected to extreme suffering does not cause one to regress to animalistic behaviour, unless you let it. Ultimately, you, <em>and you alone</em>, are completely responsible for manifesting the person you are, independently of external influences.</p><blockquote><p>&mldr; in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone.</p></blockquote><p>Frankl argues that your psyche cannot be predicted by biological, psychological and sociological preconditions. I interpreted this as more of a statement about the complexity of human nature rather than a statement about free will.</p><blockquote><p>Man has both potentialities within himself; which one is actualised depends on decisions but not on conditions.</p></blockquote><p>A universal observation is that decent and indecent people exist in all groups, regardless of what group it is â€” whether it&rsquo;s prisoners and guards, slaves and masters, or rulers and peasants, etc.</p><blockquote><p>It is apparent that the mere knowledge that a man was either a camp guard or a prisoner tells us almost nothing. Human kindness can be found in all groups, even those which as a whole it would be easy to condemn.</p></blockquote><hr><a href=#logotherapy><h2 id=logotherapy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Logotherapy</h2></a><p><em>Logos</em> is the Greek word describing &lsquo;<em>meaning</em>&rsquo;. Logotherapy is a school of therapy centered on the pursuit of meaning and its criticality in one&rsquo;s mental well-being.</p><blockquote><p>To be sure, man&rsquo;s search for meaning may arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium. However, <strong>precisely such tension is an indispensable prerequisite of mental health</strong>. There is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one&rsquo;s life.</p></blockquote><p>In my experience, feeling stress and seeing my own momentum towards goals and personal growth is a huge component of my mental health and I would be significantly less happy without struggling through something meaningful â€” mending a gap I see as critical in my life. I must always be conscientious and dissatisfied with my life in some way in order to feel any form of mental robustness.</p><blockquote><p>Thus it can be seen that <strong>mental health is based on a certain degree of tension</strong>, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.</p></blockquote><p>Caving into impulsive sexual desires leaves one feeling profoundly meaningless. You mustn&rsquo;t see it as purely impulsive pleasure â€” it should be a means to some ends. Unrestricted indulgence deprives it of meaning.</p><blockquote><p>Existential frustration often eventuates in sexual compensation&mldr; sexual libido becomes rampant in the existential vacuum.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sex is justified, even sanctified, as soon as, but only as long as, it is a <strong>vehicle of love</strong>. Thus love is not understood as a mere side-effect of sex; rather, sex is a way of expressing the experience of that ultimate togetherness which is called love.</p></blockquote><p>Think: <em>what is life asking of me</em>, rather than <em>what you are asking of life</em>. Asking for the meaning of life is a fruitless philosophical trap. Instead, the meaning of life, which differs day-to-day and man-to-man, is simply something to be discovered in your current circumstances. Live to serve.</p><blockquote><p>The true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his own psyche.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The more one forgets himself â€” by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love â€” the more human he is and the more he actualises himself.</p></blockquote><p>Moments of unavoidable suffering as part of the pursuit of some end is a prime opportunity to grow oneself and find meaning.</p><blockquote><p>&mldr; to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one&rsquo;s predicament into a human achievement.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In accepting this challenge to suffer bravely, life has a meaning up to the last moment, and it retains this meaning literally to the end.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Paradoxical intention</strong>: When experience stress or anxiety, resolve to experience it fully rather than trying to reduce it. Apply a sense of humour around this reversal of intention. &ldquo;By this treatment, the wind is taken out of the sails of the anxiety.&rdquo; When dealing with the anticipatory anxiety around having a sleepless night, for example, resolve instead to stay awake as long as possible.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/Reading/Reading/ data-ctx="Man's Search For Meaning" data-src=/Reading/Reading class=internal-link>Reading</a></li><li><a href=/Reading/Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad/ data-ctx="Man's Search For Meaning" data-src=/Reading/Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad class=internal-link>Rich Dad Poor Dad</a></li></ul></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://timz.dev>timz.dev</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/Tymotex/wiki>Github</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/timz-seng>LinkedIn</a></li></ul><p>Tim Zhang Â© 2022</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
