*CSS* (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language for describing document styling. Also see [[software-engineering/programming-languages/SCSS|SCSS]].

## Maintainable CSS
- Prefer semantic class names.
    ```html
    <!-- Semantic -->
    <div class="searchResults">
    <!-- Not semantic -->
    <div class="red pull-down m-2">
    ```
    > "... use values that describe the nature of the content, rather than values that describe the desired presentation of the content"
