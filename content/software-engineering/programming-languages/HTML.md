## SVGs
See [[software-engineering/concepts/graphics/SVGs|SVGs]]. You can put SVGs into an HTML document in the following ways:
1. You can just put the `<svg>` element in directly.
2. You can link to an SVG file with `<img src="my.svg">`.
3. You can link to an SVG file with a raster fallback with `<object data="my.svg" type="image/svg+xml"><img src="fallback.png" /></object>"`
