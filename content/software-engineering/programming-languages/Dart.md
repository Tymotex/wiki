Dart is a [[software-engineering/concepts/programming/Type System#Static Typing|statically-typed]] and [[software-engineering/concepts/programming/Object Oriented Programming|object-oriented]] programming language, designed specifically for building cross-platform apps/frontends that can be run on Android, iOS, native desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) and web browsers. Its syntax is similar to a merging of Java, JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Compilation Model
The Dart [[software-engineering/concepts/devops/Virtual Machines#Process Virtual Machine|virtual machine]], which ships with the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart), enables Dart code to be compiled to the native (machine) code for mobile devices or desktops.

Dart source code can also be transpiled to JavaScript for the web browser (using [dart2js](https://dart.dev/tools/dart2js), which also ships with the Dart SDK).

JIT compilation. 

AOT compilation.
