Docker is a containerisation tool ... there are alternatives to Docker like [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/).

When you Dockerise an app, you get portability. You can have a lot of confidence that it'll work on anything that has Docker, whether it's your laptop, a VM in a data center, a computer in your office, and so on (with some caveats like not being able to run Windows containers on Linux hosts)

Docker is especially great for deploying microservices-based applications, 

A container packages all the app's dependencies, so just distributing the Docker image is sufficient for anyone to run the app anywhere without needing to install anything else.

The host OS has the Docker daemon running.

## Containers vs. Virtual Machines
TODO.

Containers are considered substantially more lightweight than virtual machines.

Containers can have its own concept of a filesystem, networking resources, ...

Docker shares the host operating system's resources. 


### Under the hood
