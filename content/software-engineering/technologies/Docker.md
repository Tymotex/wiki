Docker is a [[software-engineering/concepts/devops/Containers|containerisation]] tool, or *container runtime*. There are alternative container runtimes like [Rocket](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-rkt) or [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/).

When you Dockerise an app, you get portability. You can have a lot of confidence that it'll work on anything that has Docker, whether it's your laptop, a VM in a data center, a computer in your office, and so on.

Docker is especially great for deploying microservices-based applications,
