*JIT (just-in-time) compilation* is when source code gets compiled on-demand at runtime as it executes rather than prior to being executed. 

JIT compilation uses less memory.

Since a JIT compiler works at runtime, it can make optimisations like inlining functions that are invoked frequently (which minimises the overhead in the low level operation of setting up a function context).

JIT compilation is a feature of an [[software-engineering/concepts/programming/Interpreter|interpreter]].
