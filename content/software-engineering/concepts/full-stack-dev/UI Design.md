- **Always prototype designs before you code**. Never design from your code[\*](https://www.toptal.com/front-end/front-end-design-principles).
- **Typography makes a huge difference**. Invest time in picking one that best expresses your frontend's 'personality'.
- **Spacing and alignment must be uniform**. It helps to use CSS/SCSS variables instead of hardcoding a `12px` and forgetting about it.
