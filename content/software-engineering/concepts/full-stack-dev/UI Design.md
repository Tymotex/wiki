**Always prototype designs before you code**. Never design from your code. Use a tool like Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, or just pen and paper.

## Spacing
**Negative spacing** is a useful weapon against visual noise. It helps the read scan for what they need. Consider using:
- Larger padding and margin.
- Larger line spacing and letter spacing.

## Typography
> **Typography makes a huge difference**. Invest time in picking one that best expresses your frontend's 'personality'.

**Font pairing** is a common practice where you pick two (or more) fonts that contrast with each other. For some reason, this looks better:

Use generators online or [handpicked font pairings](https://www.fontpair.co/) rather than sticking to one font.
