title: Tim's Dev Wiki
---

Hi! I'm Tim, a computer science student at the University of New South Wales. 

Welcome to my personal developer wiki. Learning is incredibly chaotic ‚Äî this is my attempt to establish some semblance of order to my monkey brain. This wiki contains things I learn about software engineering, computer science and a bunch of other areas of study. Since mid 2022, I finally decided to ditch [Notion](https://notion.so/) for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as my knowledge management system. I'm sharing this with the hope that it helps or inspires whoever stumbles upon it üòÉ.

üå≤ These are my [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). They're a constant work in progress ‚Äî I'm pruning, editing and adding new notes as I piece together a better understanding of software engineering as well as other areas of study that interest me.

üó∫Ô∏è To get around, use the big interactive graph above or start from the subject links below. Use `ctrl+k` to fuzzy search through the entire wiki.

üíª Curious how I made this? I used the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) editor to create a bunch of interconnected [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files, each of which correspond to a page in this wiki. To deploy those markdown files as a set of connected webpages, I forked <a href="https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz">Quartz</a>, tweaked the CSS and JavaScript to my liking, then published it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). See the source code for this project <a href="https://github.com/Tymotex/wiki">here</a>.
