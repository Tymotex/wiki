title: Tim's Dev Wiki
---

Hi! I'm Tim, a software engineer at Google. I studied computer science at the University of New South Wales. 

Welcome to my personal developer wiki. Learning is incredibly chaotic — this is my attempt to establish some semblance of order to my monkey brain. This wiki contains things I learn about software engineering, computer science and a bunch of other areas of study. Since mid 2022, I finally decided to ditch [Notion](https://notion.so/) for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as my knowledge management system. I'm sharing this with the hope that it helps or inspires whoever stumbles upon it 😃.

🌲 These are my [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). They're a constant work in progress — I'm pruning, editing and adding new notes as I piece together a better understanding of software engineering as well as other areas of study that interest me.

🗺️ To get around, use the big interactive graph above or start from the subject links below. Use `ctrl+k` to fuzzy search through the entire wiki.

💻 Curious how I made this? I used the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) editor to create a bunch of interconnected [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files, each of which correspond to a page in this wiki. To deploy those markdown files as a set of connected webpages, I forked <a href="https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz">Quartz</a>, tweaked the CSS and JavaScript to my liking, then published it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). See the source code for this project <a href="https://github.com/Tymotex/wiki">here</a>.
