Some scattered ideas about entrepreneurship, sourced from books:
- *Complete Software Developer's Career Guide* by John Sonmez.
- *So Good They Can't Ignore You* by Cal Newport.

> "Assume the business will fail, then do the smallest amount of initial setup and work to get it started." — John Sonmez

In other words, direct as much of your efforts to what matters — which is getting your idea developed and ship as soon as possible. Forget all the branding and business laws, etc. That all matters, but not if your business isn't going to survive.

Start building the business *during* your 9-5 job. If you can't tolerate this, give up. You're not mentally fit for this pursuit.

Learn [[Knowledge/Business/Sales|sales]] and [[Knowledge/Business/Marketing|marketing]]. Successful entrepreneurs who aren't competent salespeople don't exist.

Be prepared for life to truly suck as an entrepreneur.
