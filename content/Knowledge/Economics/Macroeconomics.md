An *economy* is simply the sum of all transactions that make it up. *Economic growth* is driven by transactions, ie. spending. *Macroeconomics* is the study of the aggregate behaviour of economies and aggregate variables such as a country's GDP, unemployment rate, inflation rate, etc. which are mainly produced by government statistical agencies like the [ABS](https://www.abs.gov.au/) in Australia.
