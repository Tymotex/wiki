Monetary policy is a modification of the [[Knowledge/Economics/macroeconomics/Monetary Policy#Money Supply|supply of money]] by the [[Knowledge/Economics/macroeconomics/Central Bank|Central bank]], usually in an effort to reduce [[Knowledge/Economics/macroeconomics/Inflation|inflation]], [[Knowledge/Economics/macroeconomics/Interest|interest rates]] or some other macroeconomic variable, and to ensure the stability of a countryâ€™s currency, minimal unemployment rate, and general welfare of citizens. 

Central banks will announce a **target** value for the macroeconomic variable they're trying to influence. For instance, most central banks announce a target inflation rate of $2$ to $3\%$ on average. To actually work towards achieving such a target, the central bank will tweak a variable called an **instrument** that these macroeconomic variables, of which the central banks cannot directly control, depend on. The [[Knowledge/Economics/macroeconomics/Cash Rate|cash rate]] is one of the most influential policy instruments the RBA tweaks in monetary policies.
