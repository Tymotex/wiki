The brain, from a computer engineering perspective.
- **Amygdala** — the panic button. It determines, based on external inputs, whether something calls for your body to enter an aroused state (throws an exception in runtime). This includes being hunted, hunting prey, public speaking or talking to a cute girl.
- **Hippocampus** — is the storage device providing context for a memory that can be committed to long-term storage.
- **Hypothalamus** —
- **Prefrontal cortex** — 
- **Basal Ganglia** — handles the executed of cached automated behaviours (stored and optimised procedures). Famously, this is responsible for effortlessly executing routines and habits.
