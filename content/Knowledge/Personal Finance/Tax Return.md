A tax return is a document that reports your income (from work, interest on bank accounts, investments, etc.) and expenses. You file tax returns annually in Australia, and doing so is called ‘lodging’ your tax return. It’s something you must do if you have had tax taken out of your pay over the tax year (spanning from July 1 to 30th of June).
- Your employer gives you an income statement that shows how much you earned and how much tax was deducted from your pay.
- You could pay a tax professional to help you do your tax return, or you can do it yourself with the help of tax software, like TaxSlayer.

**Why do tax returns exist?** To ensure that you pay the correct amount of tax, no more, no less. A number of things can happen over a financial year that changes how much tax you should be paying that the government cannot foresee:
- You lose your job midway through the year and don't find another, meaning you should receive money in your tax return.
- You inherited money.
- You took classes to improve your career skills.
... and so on.

### Tax Deductions
Tax deductions are expenses related to income generation that you can claim to reduce your tax. To claim something as work-related, you have to be able to prove that it’s helped you earn income. You must keep your purchase receipts around for 5 years after the claim (you can manage it in the ATO app's [myDeductions](https://ato.gov.au/mydeductions) tool).
