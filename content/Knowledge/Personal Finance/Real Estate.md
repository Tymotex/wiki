Real estate is physical land and property on that land (including its resources). It is a popular investment vehicle in markets where land and building prices increase over time.

A higher interest rate decreases the *purchasing power* of buyers, reducing demand and therefore also bringing down house prices. 
- Generally, a higher interest rate makes it harder for *both* home buyers and sellers. Overall, there will be fewer property transactions.
- Buyers can no longer qualify for bigger mortgages unless their wages increase.
- A higher interest rate can *sometimes* improve rental yield since fewer people can qualify for mortgages.



## Considerations

Location is the greatest factor.



## Property Versus Shares

**TODO**: tidy this section up.


Low interest rates and government incentives make real estate investment more attractive.

The power of leverage creates notably higher annual returns.

> Investing in properties is more subject to micro events such as changes in taxes. This is especially true in a country like Belgium that is known for its fiscal uncertainties.

Investing in real estate is harder, riskier and more complicated than index funds.


Rental income can cover most or all of the mortgage, however you cannot rely on it because there may be times where your property is vacant.

*Positive gearing* is where you take a loan to invest, but the income from the investment exceeds your loan's repayments, ie. you're getting a positive net income despite the loan repayments. *Negative gearing* is when you take a loan to invest, but the income from that investment is still lower than the loan repayment. 
- For *positively geared investments*, you have to pay tax on your rental income. For *negatively geared investments*, you can claim a tax deduction on the loss, which is better enjoyed by high income earners. 

Property expenses are tax deductible. This includes interest on your mortgage.

Real estate investment mostly does not require special domain knowledge.

- Property is illiquid.
- Costs associated with buying, holding and selling a property:
    - **Stamp duty** — a one-off tax payment associated with your purchase of a property. It's a function of location, property type and property value.
        - Concessions/Exemptions may exist as incentives for first home buyers. 
        - It's also called *transfer duty* in states other than NSW.
        - You must pay the stamp duty shortly after the property's purchase.
    - Conveyancing fees
    - Legal fees
    - Real estate agent fees
    - Search fees
    - Pest and building reports
    - Insurance
    - Landlord insurance
    - **Body corporate** — 
    - Land tax
    - Repairs and maintenance 
    - TODO: strata?
    - Capital gains tax, if the property has increased in value
- Settlement periods can span weeks or months.
- You can borrow huge amounts of money to acquire a property and therefore can take advantage of higher *leverage*, which is an investment strategy involving borrowing money to increase potential returns. It's sometimes 'unfair' to compare % capital growth between shares and property if you don't account for the 'cheap' leverage you can get through acquiring a property through a mortgage.
    - You can also borrow money to invest in shares, just not as much. Doing this is called 'investing on margin', and you are subject to *margin calls* where the lender can request back their money if the value of the securities you invest in fall below a threshold.

- You must have a secure enough income stream to meet mortgage repayments.
- You must be able to respond to increases in mortgage repayments from interest rate hikes.

Picking an investment property:
- Find areas of high growth, high rental yield, low vacancy rates.
- What are proposed developments in the suburb?
- Consider: 
    - Distance to reputable schools.
    - Distance to shopping centres and transport.
    - Garage.
    - Bathrooms.

Your property is exempt from capital gains tax if you're an Australian resident and you've lived in the home for the whole period of owning it and has not been used for business activity.

**House buying process**:
1. Contact a bank or mortgage broker to acquire a *pre-approval*. How much you can borrow is a function of your income, job history, credit rating, etc.
2. Inspect the home for damage, broken things, pests, etc. Consider paying for a thorough pest and building inspection.
3. Get a conveyancer to review the contract.
