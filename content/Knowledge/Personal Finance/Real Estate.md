Real estate is physical land and property on that land (including its resources). It is a popular investment vehicle in markets where land and building prices increase over time.

Arguments for and against real estate investing:
- You can borrow to finance the asset, meaning you can **leverage** a huge amount. It's not possible to leverage to the same extent for other investments like shares.
- **Transactions costs are huge, 'forcing' you to buy and hold for several years (7+)**. Any capital gains may be nullified by the transactions costs. Expect a total transaction cost of around 10% the purchase price of the property (stamp duty, real estate agent commissions, etc.)
- **Illiquid**. You can't pull money out of your investments like for shares. This is sometimes argued as a strength because it keeps investors committed to buying and holding.
- You have **finer control** over the investment compared to shares. With shares, you cannot determine how businesses operate. With real estate, you can make improvements (*sweat equity*) and negotiate for below-market prices.
- Quality investments usually require **far greater starting sums**. You'd need several thousands of dollars to get started in real estate investing, which definitely isn't the case for shares.
- Requires **far more of your time and energy** compared to passively investing in shares. Some time sinks include:
	- Finding professionals to work with.
	- Being a landlord.
	- Researching suburbs and zoning.
- You will be living with day-to-day **emotional challenges and toil** of being a investment property owner. **You should be interested in real estate**. If you have too many work/family obligations or want to channel your time/energy into starting a business, reconsider real estate as an investment. Some headaches include:
	- Tenants causing problems.
	- Building maintenance.
	- Frustration dealing with real estate agents.
- Tax incentives for investors:
	- Negative gearing. Unlike other countries, Australia's tax system lets you make unlimited deductions for income losses on investment properties.
		- If, according to the accounting, your property lost $20000 for this year, and your income was $100000, then you're only taxed on $80000.
	- Property expenses are tax deductible:
		- Interest on mortgage.
		- Building depreciation.
	- Capital gains tax reductions.
		- 50% discount on CGT when you've held the property for over a year (which makes the vast majority of real estate investors eligible).
	
## Interest Rate
A higher interest rate decreases the *purchasing power* of buyers, reducing demand and therefore also bringing down house prices. 
- Generally, a higher interest rate makes it harder for *both* home buyers and sellers. Overall, there will be fewer property transactions.
- Buyers can no longer qualify for bigger mortgages unless their wages increase.
- A higher interest rate can *sometimes* improve rental yield since fewer people can qualify for mortgages.

**You can be prompted to buy a new home by either lower interest rates, or lower housing prices (or both).**

## Gearing
***Positive** gearing* is where you take a loan to invest, but the income from the investment *exceeds* your loan's repayments, ie. you're getting a positive net income despite the loan repayments. 
- For *positively geared investments*, you have to pay tax on your rental income. 

***Negative** gearing* is when you take a loan to invest, but the income from that investment is still lower than the loan repayment. 
- For *negatively geared investments*, you can claim a tax deduction on the loss, which is better enjoyed by high income earners. This is a favourable tax policy for investors that also exists in some other countries such as Japan and New Zealand.

**TODO**: tidy this section up.


Low interest rates and government incentives make real estate investment more attractive.

The power of leverage creates notably higher annual returns.

> Investing in properties is more subject to micro events such as changes in taxes. This is especially true in a country like Belgium that is known for its fiscal uncertainties.

Investing in real estate is harder, riskier and more complicated than index funds.


Rental income can cover most or all of the mortgage, however you cannot rely on it because there may be times where your property is vacant.

Real estate investment mostly does not require special domain knowledge.

- Property is illiquid.
- Costs associated with buying, holding and selling a property:
    - **Stamp duty** — a one-off tax payment associated with your purchase of a property. It's a function of location, property type and property value.
        - Concessions/Exemptions may exist as incentives for first home buyers. 
        - It's also called *transfer duty* in states other than NSW.
        - You must pay the stamp duty shortly after the property's purchase.
    - Conveyancing fees
    - Legal fees
    - Real estate agent fees
    - Search fees
    - Pest and building reports
    - Insurance
    - Landlord insurance
    - **Body corporate** — 
    - Land tax
    - Repairs and maintenance 
    - TODO: strata?
    - Capital gains tax, if the property has increased in value
- Settlement periods can span weeks or months.
- You can borrow huge amounts of money to acquire a property and therefore can take advantage of higher *leverage*, which is an investment strategy involving borrowing money to increase potential returns. It's sometimes 'unfair' to compare % capital growth between shares and property if you don't account for the 'cheap' leverage you can get through acquiring a property through a mortgage.
    - You can also borrow money to invest in shares, just not as much. Doing this is called 'investing on margin', and you are subject to *margin calls* where the lender can request back their money if the value of the securities you invest in fall below a threshold.

- You must have a secure enough income stream to meet mortgage repayments.
- You must be able to respond to increases in mortgage repayments from interest rate hikes.

Picking an investment property:
- Find areas of high growth, high rental yield, low vacancy rates.
- What are proposed developments in the suburb?
- Consider: 
    - Distance to reputable schools.
    - Distance to shopping centres and transport.
    - Garage.
    - Bathrooms.

Your property is exempt from capital gains tax if you're an Australian resident and you've lived in the home for the whole period of owning it and has not been used for business activity.

**House buying process**:
1. Contact a bank or mortgage broker to acquire a *pre-approval*. How much you can borrow is a function of your income, job history, credit rating, etc.
2. Inspect the home for damage, broken things, pests, etc. Consider paying for a thorough pest and building inspection.
3. Get a conveyancer to review the contract.
