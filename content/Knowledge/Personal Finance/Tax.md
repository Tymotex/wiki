Taxes are payments that you *must* pay to the government, mainly through your income, capital gains and dividends. Taxes also exist on transactions for specific goods and services, as well as on specific imports from a specific country (which we call *tariffs*). It exists to provide income to the government which then uses the money to fund public healthcare, education, defence, infrastructure, and other public goods and services.

*Tax withholding* is the income tax that is taken out of your gross income by your employer that is routed to the ATO. This is part of the *pay-as-you-go* (PAYG) system implemented by the government to 'tax at the source'.

## Tax Evasion & Tax Avoidance
*Tax evasion* or *tax fraud* is the illegal act of lying about your income or claiming an unpermitted tax deduction with the intention of reducing your tax. An easy way to accidentally commit tax fraud is by using the same capital asset, such as a car or computer, for personal *and* business use, or by not reporting cash payments you receive from others. Clear record-keeping helps to avoid such accidents. 

*Tax avoidance* is strategically minimising the amount of tax you pay, within legality. It mostly does not involve deception or dishonesty like in tax evasion.
