*Nutrition* is the study of *nutrients*, which are substances consumed by organisms that are necessary for survival.

Nutrients are subclassed into:
1. Proteins.
2. Carbohydrates.
3. Fats.
4. Vitamins.
5. Minerals & electrolytes.
6. Water.
7. fibre (although whether this is a nutrient is not clear).

Some tl;dr notes:
- $\approx 85\%$ of your energy is sourced from fats and carbs. The remaining $\approx 15\%$ is sourced from proteins. ([Source](https://healthinfo.healthengine.com.au/introduction-to-nutrition))
    - The brain consumes $\approx 55\%$ of total energy.
- All carbs must be processed into glucose for metabolism.

## Proteins


## Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are subdivided into:
1. *Monosaccharides*
    1. Glucose
    2. Fructose
    3. Galactose
2. *Disaccharides* 
    1. Sucrose
    2. Lactose
    3. Maltose
3. *Polysaccharides* 
    1. Starch
    2. Fibre

All carbohydrates must be reduced to glucose first before metabolism.
