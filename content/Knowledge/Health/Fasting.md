title: Fasting
---

- Human growth hormone increases during fasting.
- Resting energy metabolism *increases* during fasting, unintuitively.
- You should enter ketosis within a few days of fasting.

Observations on hunger:
- You'll tend to be very hungry throughout the first day, but this will subside in subsequent days.
- You do not get hungrier as time goes on. Paradoxically, it tends to decrease further in the future for short-term fasts.
- Ghrelin spikes at expected eating times, but subsides over a few hours after.
