title: Protein Powder
---

There are many different natural foods that protein powders derive from. Whey is probably the best for its balanced amino acid profile and fast absorption into the body.

Whey protein powders are subclassed into:
- Whey concentrate
- Whey isolate (more processed, fewer fats and carbs). This is generally recommended, especially for lactose-intolerant people.
- Why hydrolysate (most processed)

Picking a protein powder product:
- Avoid proprietary blends.
- Avoid amino matrices (which might indicate protein spiking).
- Prefer higher protein-per-serving. Pay attention to the difference between serving size and protein in that serving. 
    - E.g. a protein powder might have a 30g serving size and 24g protein.
- Many protein powders have detectable levels of heavy metals and plastics like BPA.
