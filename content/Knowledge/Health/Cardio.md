VO2 Max (volume oxygen max, or maximal oxygen consumption). Once a week.

VO2 Max is highly correlated with longevity, apparently more so than any other health metric known so far.

TODO: stroke volume.

*Max heart rate* is the highest heart rate you can achieve. The formula to estimate it is $220 - \texttt{age}$.

## Zones
Heart rate zones 
1. **Zone 1** — 50-60% of max heart rate.
    - You'll hit this when walking.
2. **Zone 2** — 60-70% of max heart rate.
    - You can pass the *talk test* and speak in full sentences without gasping for breath.
    - You would typically spend most of your time in this zone.
3. **Zone 3** — 70-80% of max heart rate.
4. **Zone 4** — 80-90% of max heart rate.
    - You can say a couple of words, but are not dying.
5. **Zone 5** — 90-100% of max heart rate.
