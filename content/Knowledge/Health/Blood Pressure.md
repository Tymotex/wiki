title: Blood Pressure

Blood pressure is the physical pressure exerted on the walls of your blood vessels (arteries, in most contexts) by your circulating blood. It's reported with 2 numbers with *millimetres of mercury* (mmHg) being the standard pressure unit used:
- *Systolic pressure* – the pressure measured when the heart has pumped.
- *Diastolic pressure* – the pressure measured between heartbeats.

A blood pressure reported under 120/80mmHg (120mmHg systolic and 80mmHg diastolic) is considered normal. 

**Hypertension** is the persistent state of high blood pressure. Blood pressures over 140/90mmHg are considered hypertensive.

High blood pressure damages blood vessels, potentially causing ruptures. It's regarded as a significant risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
