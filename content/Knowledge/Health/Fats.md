A **fat** is an [ester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester) of [[Knowledge/Health/Fatty Acids|fatty acids]]. Fats are a type of *lipid*, although they're often used synonymously.

Vegetable oil's molecular structure looks like this, for example:

## Unsaturated Fats
Unsaturated fats are fats that contain at least 1 Carbon-Carbon double bond in the fatty acid chain.

- Liquid at room temperature.
- Mostly sourced from plants rather than animals.
- Generally considered 'healthy' fats because they can reduce [[Knowledge/Health/Cholesterol|LDL cholesterol]] levels.

There are:
- **Monounsaturated fats** — contains exactly one double bond.
    - Sourced from avocados, nuts, seeds, plant oils for example.
- **Polyunsaturated fats** — contains more than one double bond.
    - *Omega-3* fats are important polyunsaturated fats sourced mainly from fish, nuts, seeds, that cannot be synthesised by the body.

### Trans Fat
The double bond in unsaturated fats allows for 2 possible arrangements of atoms: *cis* and *trans*.

Unsaturated fats arranged in the *trans* configuration are trans fats. The shape of a fat makes a huge difference.
- Like saturated fats, trans fats increase LDL (by stimulating cholesterol synthesis in the liver) and decrease HDL cholesterol. They're considered *worse for health than saturated fats*, despite being an unsaturated fat which is credited with being healthier than saturated fats.
- Trans fats are very cheap to synthesise and are useful for increasing shelf life and for frying.
- Trans fats occur naturally in small amounts in meat and dairy.

*Fat hydrogenation* is a technique used to convert unsaturated fats to trans fats. To know whether a food has trans fat, look for the words '**partially hydrogenated**'. It is insufficient to just look for 0g trans fat. 

### Trans Fats
Trans fat is a class of unsaturated fats, considered the worst kind of fat to eat because it tends to increase LDL cholesterol and reduce HDL cholesterol.

## Saturated Fats
Saturated fats are fats containing no Carbon-Carbon double bonds in the fatty acid chain.

Saturated fats are considered unhealthy because they increase LDL cholesterol levels by reducing the effectiveness of LDL receptors in the liver.
