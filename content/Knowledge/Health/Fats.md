- Generally considered 'healthy' fats because they can improve cholesterol levels.
- Liquid at room temperature.
- Mostly sourced from plants rather than animals.

There are:
- **Monounsaturated fats** — contains exactly one double bond.
    - Sourced from avocados, nuts, seeds, plant oils for example.
- **Polyunsaturated fats** — contains more than one double bond.
    - *Omega-3* fats are important polyunsaturated fats sourced mainly from fish, nuts, seeds, that cannot be synthesised by the body.

Saturated fats are generally considered 'bad'.

## Saturated Fats
Saturated fats are fats containing no Carbon-Carbon double bonds in the fatty acid chain.
- Mostly sourced from animals, and some plants such as coconuts.

Saturated fats are considered unhealthy because they increase LDL cholesterol levels by reducing the effectiveness of LDL receptors in the liver.
