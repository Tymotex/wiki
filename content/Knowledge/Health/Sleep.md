title: Sleep Hygiene
---

Sleep should be treated as a *non-negotiable commitment*. It should never be traded away for anything else. Good sleep improves you on every dimension in life. Likewise, bad sleep diminishes you in every dimension. Excluding exercise, there's almost nothing else that impacts your quality of life as much as sleep.

## Sleep Hygiene
Here are the basics to maximising the odds of best sleep:
- Get your bedroom as dark and quiet as possible. 
- 18.3Â°C is about the optimal bedroom temperature.
- Wind down for at least 30 minutes before sleeping in dim lighting. Consider having the following:
    - Reading.
    - Warm shower.
    - Meditation (focused less on attentiveness and more on relaxation and deep breathing).
    - Journaling to dump all your worries and exhaust your thoughts.
- **Stop drinking water before bed**. Drink all you need 2 hours before sleeping, at the latest.
- Sleep and wake at the same time.
