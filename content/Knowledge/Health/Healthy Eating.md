- Average powerlifting session burns ~150 kcals.
- 5km at 5:00/km burns ~340 kcals.

Each day I should aim to eat:
- 10-20% [[Knowledge/Health/Calories|caloric surplus]] → ~400 calories in my case, which is basically 2 potatoes.
- ~2g of protein per kg of body weight → ~140g in my case.

### Favourite Foods

## Guidelines
> In general, prefer food that has been **modified the least** from their natural state.

### Fried foods
- Avoid fried restaurant meals because they may contain higher [[Knowledge/Health/Nutrition#Trans fat|trans fats]] due to the oil used. Re-using frying oils result in more oil breaking down and forming trans fats.
- Avoid all deep-fried foods.
- Prefer pure olive oil and avocado oil for high temperature frying.
- Prefer extra virgin olive oil (which is less processed than pure olive oil) for low temperature frying (because of its lower smoke point).

### Meats
- Avoid processed meats (eg. bacon, sausages, salami).
- Avoid fatty cuts of beef or pork.
- Mince is not considered processed.

### Fats
- Avoid butter and margarine.
