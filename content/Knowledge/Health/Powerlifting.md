The squat mainly targets the quadriceps, hip muscles, glutes, and targets to a lesser extent the hamstrings, calves and abdominals.

### Technique
1. **'Building the shelf'**:
    1. Grip as closely as your shoulder mobility allows for. A narrower grip results in a sturdier shelf, but can result in form breakdown at the bottom of the squat if you're lacking in mobility.
        - Grip style doesn't matter. Just use either a standard overhand grip or false grip
    2. Place bar on your upper traps
    3. Pinch your shoulders together.
    4. Push your elbows backwards.
    5. Keep tight and hold all that upper body tension the entire time.
    6. *(First breath)* Breathe air into your diaphragm and brace your core.

2. **Pop** the bar off the rack by driving hips forward.
3. **3-step walkout**: take one big step back, another to roughly meet the other foot, another to get into the final squat stance. Be quick and energy-efficient, but don't rush.
    1. Prefer a shoulder-width stance or slightly wider. Point your toes slightly outwards.
4. **Pre-descent**: be patient and don't rush into descent after the walkout.
    1. *(Second breath)* Breathe air into your diaphragm and brace your core as if you're about to take a punch to the gut.
    2. Look out to the horizon.
5. **Descent**:
    1. *(Optional)* Push your hips back *very slightly*, *just* before descent. This is called hip-first and is an alternative to creasing the hip and knees *simultaneously* to start the descent. *Never focus on bending on the knee first*.
    2. Drop down in a controlled manner (taking ~1 second), *going as low as you can*. At least get the hip crease below the knee.
    - Keep your elbows pushed back slightly, not directly below the bar.
    - Keep the weight distributed equally across your feet throughout the whole descent and ascent.
    - Keep your chest outwards. A cue is to point your chest up.
6. **Ascent**:
    1. Push the world away.
    - Never let your hips shoot up.
    - Never let your knees cave in. Always track your knees in the same direction as your toes.
8. Keep knees pointed in the same direction as toes are pointed throughout both descent and ascent.
