High bar squat:

The squat mainly targets the quadriceps, hip muscles, glutes, and targets to a lesser extent the hamstrings, calves and abdominals.

### Technique
1. **'Building the shelf'**:
    1. Grip as closely as your shoulder mobility allows for. A narrower grip results in a sturdier shelf, but can result in form breakdown at the bottom of the squat if you're lacking in mobility.
        - Grip style doesn't matter. Just use either a standard overhand grip or false grip
    2. Place bar on your upper traps
    3. Pinch your shoulders together.
    4. Push your elbows backwards.
    5. Keep tight and hold all that upper body tension the entire time.
    6. *(First breath)* Breathe air into your diaphragm and brace your core.

2. **Pop** the bar off the rack by driving hips forward.
3. **3-step walkout**: take one big step back, another to roughly meet the other foot, another to get into the final squat stance. Be quick and energy-efficient, but don't rush.
    1. Prefer a shoulder-width stance or slightly wider. Point your toes slightly outwards.
4. **Pre-descent**: be patient and don't rush into descent after the walkout.
    1. *(Second breath)* Breathe air into your diaphragm and brace your core as if you're about to take a punch to the gut.
    2. Look out to the horizon.
5. **Descent**:
    1. *(Optional)* Push your hips back *very slightly*, *just* before descent. This is called hip-first and is an alternative to creasing the hip and knees *simultaneously* to start the descent. *Never focus on bending on the knee first*.
    2. 'Open your groin' and drop down in a controlled manner (taking ~1 second), *going as low as you can*. At least get the hip crease below the knee.
        - Focus on opening your groin instead of pushing your knees out[\*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsXj2fQ4uow&ab_channel=MarkBell-SuperTrainingGym). You'll sit backwards and will feel less stress on the knees.
    - Keep your elbows pushed back slightly, not directly below the bar.
    - Keep the weight distributed equally across your feet throughout the whole descent and ascent.
    - Keep your chest outwards. A cue is to point your chest up.
6. **Ascent**:
    1. *Push the world away*. Push your back against the barbell.
    - Never let your hips shoot up.
    - Never let your knees cave in. Always track your knees in the same direction as your toes.
    - Keep knees pointed in the same direction as toes are pointed throughout both descent and ascent.

## Bench Press

## Deadlift

The deadlift mainly targets hamstrings, glutes, back and lats, and to a lesser extent forearms, traps, abdominals.

### Technique
> Lift barefoot or in deadlift shoes. Don't lift in running shoes.
1. **Beginning stance**:
    1. Put the middle of your feet directly under the barbell at <= shoulder-width with toes slightly pointed out.
        - A narrow stance prevents knees from caving in and lets you grip so that your arms are closer to being perpendicular to the ground.
    2. Grab the barbell without moving your shins and without moving the barbell.
        - Your grip width should be roughly where your arms naturally hang.
        - Choose one of these grip styles: double overhand standard, mixed grip, double hook grip.
    3. Push knees forward until shins meet the barbell and without moving the barbell.
    4. Breathe deeply into your diaphragm and brace your core as if you were about to punched in the gut.
    5. Push chest through, push shoulders down, engage your lats (by thinking about reaching your hands as far down as possible).
    6. (Optional) Push your knees gently *into* the crease of your elbows. Your knees should be aligned with your forearms.

    7. Look slightly downwards.
    - Your shoulders should be slightly past the barbell. Your shoulder blades (scapula) should be directly up from the barbell.
    - Your arms should be close to vertical, ie. perpendicular to the ground.
    - You should feel extremely tight just before you begin the lift.
    - Weight should be distributed evenly across your feet.
    - Your lower back should never curve outwards.
2. **Lift**:
    1. Right before you lift, pull the slack out of the barbell. You'll hear a click. Never jerk the barbell. 
    2. *Just stand up*, or *explode up*, or *push the world away*. Drag the barbell up along your shins, knees and thighs the whole way through.
    3. Once the barbell is above knees, squeeze your glutes hard and thrust your hips forward to lock out.
3. **Lowering**:
    1. Lower the barbell in a straight line down, not around your knees. Do this by first pushing your hips back and letting the barbell slide off your thighs.
4. **Repeating**: using deadstop over touch & go.
    1. Stop the barbell entirely on the ground. Don't take advantage of the bounce to start the next rep.
