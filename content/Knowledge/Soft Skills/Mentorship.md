### Selflessness
Always show your willingness to help your peers, *even to the extent of putting them before yourself*. It is much better to build a reputation as a selfless, giving person that aggressively pushes themselves and everyone else up instead of *only* themselves.

Competition is good, but drop any desire to 'beat' the other person in your personal interactions with them. Always demonstrate authentic selflessness and a desire to see the other person succeed. 

Stop treating your career as a zero-sum game. Drop the idea that you need to beat everyone else and keep your knowledge and 'secrets' hidden to maximise your job security.
