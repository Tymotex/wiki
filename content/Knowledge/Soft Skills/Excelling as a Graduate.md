title: Excelling as a Graduate
---

- Learn how to ask for help, *properly*. Show that you've exhausted yourself and have taken reasonable initiative, *always*.
    Explain your understanding of the problem, your goals, and your assumptions. 
    List all the things you tried. Explain why each failed.
    "I'd appreciate it if you could point me in the next direction."
- Technical skills are abundant and aren't sufficient alone to impress people. You must be extremely technically competent *and* someone with excellent communication skills.
- **Don't be a hotshot junior**. You'll cringe at yourself and fall into arrogant thinking patterns.
