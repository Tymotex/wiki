**Big data** is the massive and continually expanding volume of structured and unstructured data produced constantly by people and organisations.

Structured data includes things like CSVs, spreadsheets, database records, etc. while unstructured data includes things like pictures, emails, etc.

Big data usually necessitates the usage of [[Knowledge/Engineering/Distributed Systems/Distributed Systems|distributed systems]] in order to tolerate the massive storage and processing requirements.
