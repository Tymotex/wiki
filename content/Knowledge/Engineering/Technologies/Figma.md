## Shortcuts
```shell
v   # Move tool    (same as in Photoshop)
f   # Frame tool
p   # Pen tool
t   # Text tool   
h   # Hand tool
c   # Comment tool

# Panel
alt + 1            # Switch to layers tab
alt + 2            # Switch to assets tab
shift + e          # Quickly toggle betweeen design and prototype tabs

# Layer
ctrl + r           # Rename layer

# Group
ctrl + g           # Creates a group that contains all highlighted elements
ctrl + shift + g   # Ungroup highlighted elements

# Frame
ctrl + alt + g     # Creates a frame that contains all highlighted elements
ctrl + shift + g   # Unframes highlighted elements (same shortcut as ungrouping)

# Component
ctrl + alt + k     # Creates a component that contains all highlighted elements
```

## Left Panel

### **Layers**
All your design elements appear in the layers panel and will be nested within other elements such as *frames*. Each design element has a symbol that tells you what type of element it is:
- ***Frames** —* usually the top-level container for everything else
    ![[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/assets/frame.svg]]
- **[*Groups*](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/groups-versus-frames/)** —  a container for multiple elements, letting them be moved and resized uniformly and organise your layers
    ![[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/assets/group.svg]]
- ***Components*** — reusable design elements in your *assets*
    ![[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/assets/instance.svg]]

- ***Instance*** — instantiations of components
    ![[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/assets/component.svg]]
- **Text**
    ![[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/assets/text.svg]]
- **Shape**
    ![[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/assets/shape.svg]]
- **Image**
    ![[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/assets/image.svg]]
- **GIF**
    ![[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/assets/gif.svg]]
You can have multiple *[pages](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038511293)* in a single Figma file. Each page has its own canvas.

## Right Panel
- **Design** — lets you view and tweak properties of any design element. What is shown in this panel is determined by what you currently have selected
    - If no element is selected, then you'll see some local styles and canvas properties
        ![[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/assets/figma-right-panel-no-frame.png|200]]
- **Prototype** — lets you set up interactive user-flow logic
- **Inspect** — shows you a summary of properties and how the design maps to real CSS code (or Android/iOS code)

## Components
Components are reusable design elements. You can create them from layers, groups and frames.
- **Master component** — or just component, defines the base properties of a component.
- **Instance** — a copy of the master component where you can *override* properties.
    - Copy and pasting a master component will create an *instance* of a master component.
    - Updating the master component's properties will cause its instances to 'sync' with that change.
    - Useful operations:
        - Jump to master component
        - Reset instance — clear all overrides
        - Detach from master

## Libraries
Libraries are groups of [[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/Figma#Components|components]] that can be published or imported.

## Prototyping
Lets you set up interactive logic in presentation mode. Examples of common use cases:
- Setting up transitions between frames based on user events like clicking, hovering, etc.
- Overflow behaviour — lets you set up scrolling, good for demonstrating carousels for example

You can create *connections* between any element and any top-level frame.
