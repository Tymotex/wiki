[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source real-time monitoring and alerting tool. It's a popular choice for monitoring [[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/Kubernetes|Kubernetes]] clusters, Linux servers, Raspberry Pis, etc. It's commonly combined with [[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/Grafana|Grafana]] to make a nice dashboard UI available for us to quickly understand a software system's metrics.

Popular programming languages have a Prometheus client library that lets you track and expose metrics.

## Usage
### Installing Prometheus Server
```sh
# Download a precompiled binary from https://prometheus.io/download/.
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.38.0/prometheus-2.38.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf prometheus-*.tar.gz

# Run prometheus server.
# View the default dashboard at localhost:9090.
cd prometheus-*
./prometheus
```
Downloading a precompiled binary is the [recommended installation method](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus#install). Alternatively, you could build directly from source or pull the Docker image and run the Prometheus server in a container with: `docker run --name prometheus -d -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 prom/prometheus`.

### Installing Node Exporter
A *node* in this context is basically just a virtual machine. The `node_exporter` binary, maintained officially by Prometheus, is something you can run on a machine whose resources such as memory, disk, CPU you want to make available for a prometheus server to scrape.
```sh
# Download a precompiled binary from https://prometheus.io/download/#node_exporter.
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.4.0-rc.0/node_exporter-1.4.0-rc.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz  
tar -xvf node_exporter-*.tar.gz

# Run node exporter (which also runs a web server that presents some output viewable at localhost:9100).
cd node_exporter-*
./node_exporter
```

### Configuration
In the directory containing the Prometheus binary, set the configuration in the file `prometheus.yml`. If running a Docker container, use a [bind mount](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus) to make the container use your own configuration file.

To get the prometheus server to pull from the node exporter on the same machine, set:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9100"]
```


- Scrape interval
- Retention time â€” the time that metric datapoints stick around before being discarded (to save space).

## Architecture
![[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/assets/prometheus-architecture.png|800]]
([official source](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus))

In the above diagram, a machine running a [[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/Prometheus#Installing Prometheus Server|prometheus server]] does the following:
1. Finds the targets it's meant to pull metrics from.
2. Pulls metrics from **exporters** and possibly other prometheus servers.
    - Prometheus uses an HTTP pull model where a Prometheus server sends an HTTP request to a dedicated endpoint exposed by target services to pull metrics from them. This usually results in light network traffic than the alternative, which is to get targets to actively push out data to a prometheus server.
3. Makes the metrics available for a client (such as Grafana) to consume via **[[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/Prometheus#PromQL|PromQL]]**.
4. Pushes alerts to you based on thresholds/conditions you set, using **AlertManager**.

A **target** is a service that exposes metrics in a format Prometheus knows how to work with. A Prometheus server pulls (also called 'scrapes') data from targets. Targets you might be interested in monitoring include:
- Linux VM running in the cloud.
- Kubernetes cluster.
- Your Raspberry Pi.
- ... and so on.

An **exporter** is what lets you map metrics collected from a system into Prometheus data. It also starts a web server exposing the path `/metrics` that can be scraped.
- There are 100+ exporters ([official docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/)).

### PromQL
Prometheus has its own custom database for storing real-time metrics. **PromQL** is a language for querying metrics from that database, useful for extracting insights that can be displayed on a frontend like Grafana for developers to see.
