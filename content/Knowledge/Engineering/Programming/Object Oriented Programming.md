Object-oriented programming is a [[Knowledge/Engineering/Programming/Programming Paradigm|programming paradigm]] that sees programs as a collection of *objects* interacting with each other. *Objects* are just containers for some data (called 'fields') and functions (called 'methods').

Object-oriented programming involves heavy usage of [[Knowledge/Engineering/Programming/Object Oriented Programming#Classes|classes]] and enable us to make use of concepts like [[Knowledge/Engineering/Programming/Object Oriented Programming#Encapsulation|encapsulation]], [[Knowledge/Engineering/Programming/Object Oriented Programming#Inheritance|inheritance]], [[Knowledge/Engineering/Programming/Object Oriented Programming#Polymorphism|polymorphism]], etc.

### Classes
TODO.

#### Static Classes
TODO.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is about *hiding the implementation details* of a class as much as possible. Doing so will tend to minimise [[Areas/Reading/Clean Code|coupling]].

**Access modifiers**
Access modifiers are used to explicitly apply different levels of visibility to the members of a class. OO programming languages will usually give you the following 3 access modifiers.
- `private` – only accessible within the class.
- `protected` – accessible within the class *and* within its subclasses.
- `public` – accessible by any class in the program.

Languages might have variations on how these access modifiers behave, as well as what the default visibility is when you omit the access modifier. Eg. In Java, a `protected` member is also visible to classes in the same package. 

In general, prefer the most restricted visibility possible.

### Inheritance
Inheritance (also called 'subclassing') is when you make one class derive from a base class, causing the child class to *inherit* the parent class' non-private members.

**Differences between languages**
Languages will have different syntax for inheritance and ways for subclasses to access their parent class. They may also differ in whether they support [**multiple inheritance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance) or not.
- In C++, the inheritance might look like `class Sub : public Base`. *Note*: C++ has concepts like private/public inheritance that other languges don't have.
- In JavaScript, inheritance looks like `class Sub extends Base`. Within the `Sub` class, you have access the base class' constructor and methods via the `super` keyword.
- In C#, inheritance looks like `public class Sub : Base`. Subclasses can access the base class' members through the `base` keyword (which is similar to JavaScript's `super` keyword).

### Polymorphism
TODO.

#### Static Polymorphism
TODO.

#### Dynamic Polymorphism
TODO.

### Method Overidding
Method overriding is when you make a subclass provide an implementation for a method that's defined in its base class. Method overriding enables **[[Knowledge/Engineering/Programming/Object Oriented Programming#Dynamic Polymorphism|runtime polymorphism]]**.

**Differences between languages**
In many languages, overriding is implicitly done, but it's recommended to explicitly label it.
- In TypeScript and C++, you can optionally add the `override` modifier.
- In Java, you can optionally annotate overridden methods with `@Override`.
- In C#, you must use the `override` modifier.

### Abstract Class
An abstract class is just one you can't instantiate, *forcing* the user to choose and instantiate a specific concrete subclass that inherits from the abstract class. 

Abstract classes let you define **both** *concrete methods* and *abstract methods*. If you find that you don't need to define concrete methods, which is usually the majority of the time, then consider using an [[Knowledge/Engineering/Programming/Object Oriented Programming#Interface|interface]] instead.

**Differences between languages**
Making a class abstract differs between programming languages.
- In TypeScript, prefix a class with `abstract`.
- In C#, prefix a class with `abstract`.
- In C++, give the class at least one [[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/C++|pure virtual function]], eg. `virtual void foo() = 0;`. There is no `abstract` keyword.

#### Abstract Method
*You can only define abstract methods inside an abstract class*. Abstract methods are ones that **must be overridden** and implemented by the subclasses. If you want to provide a default implementation and allow for subclasses to optionally override a method, use [[Knowledge/Engineering/Programming/Object Oriented Programming#Virtual Method|virtual methods]] instead.

You cannot make abstract methods static.

**Differences between languages**
To define abstract methods:
- In TypeScript, you'd use the `abstract` modifier.
- In C#, you'd use the `abstract` modifier.
- In C++, define a pure virtual function: `virtual void foo() = 0;`.

### Virtual Method
Virtual methods are methods that can be overridden by subclasses. To force subclasses to implement a method, use [[Knowledge/Engineering/Programming/Object Oriented Programming#Abstract Method|abstract methods]] instead.

You cannot make virtual methods static.

**Differences between languages**
To define virtual methods:
- In some languages like C# and TypeScript, methods are virtual by default.
- In C++, you'd use the `virtual` modifier, but it's a little complicated because you can still override methods without it. See [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2391679/why-do-we-need-virtual-functions-in-c).

### Interface
An interface is a 'contract' that defines what a user can do with the classes that *implement* that interface. You define the methods (and sometimes constants) that the interface supports, and then leave the implementation details to the subclasses. An interface is not a class, so you cannot instantiate it.

You **cannot supply any implementation** inside interfaces. If you want to provide *some* concrete methods, then consider using an [[Knowledge/Engineering/Programming/Object Oriented Programming#Abstract Class|abstract class]] instead. That being said, some programming languages like C# let you implement a static members inside an interface.

**Differences between languages**
- In TypeScript, you define an interface like this: `interface Blog { ... }`, but it's also used generally outside of OO design.
- In C#, you define an interface like this: `public interface IFoo { ... }`.
- In C++, there is no native concept of interfaces, but you can simulate it by making an abstract class whose methods *are all* abstract, ie. all of them are pure virtual functions. Implementing an interface is therefore the same as inheritance.
All interface members are public by default.
