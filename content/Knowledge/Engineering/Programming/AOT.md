*AOT (ahead-of-time) compilation* involves compiling an entire application's source code into an executable (or some other target) before running the application. This is the traditional type of compilation model for [[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/C|C]], [[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/C++|C++]], [[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/Go|Go]] and similar languages. Compilers like `gcc` are AOT compilers.
