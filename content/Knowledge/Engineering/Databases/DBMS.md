**DBMS** (database management system) is a software application that allows the creation, access and administration of a *database*. E.g. [[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/PostgreSQL|PostgreSQL]] is a DBMS.

A **database** is just a collection of data that is arranged in a way that is easily accessed and maintained.
- *Relational databases* are where you organise all your data as tables that have relationships with each other.
- *Non-relational databases* are those where you don't use tables. Instead:
    - **Document-oriented** — 
    - **Graph** —
