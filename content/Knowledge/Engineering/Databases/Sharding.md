Sharding in databases is where you partition up a database's contents to be hosted on several machines.

It's not feasible to store most production databases on 1 machine. Inevitably, you have to scale horizontally. It's easier to scale non-relational databases than relational databases (because of the [[Knowledge/Engineering/Databases/ACID|ACID]] transaction model).
