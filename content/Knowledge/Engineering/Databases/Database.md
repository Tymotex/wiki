A **database** is just a collection of data that is arranged in a way that is easily accessed and maintained.
- **Relational databases** are where you organise all your data as tables that have relationships with each other.
- **Non-relational databases** are those where you don't use tables. Instead they could be:
    - **Document-oriented** — essentially all your data is stored as JSONs, which we call *documents*.
    - **Graph** — we model the data as a [[Knowledge/Engineering/Algorithms/Graph|graph]], storing it as nodes and edges.
