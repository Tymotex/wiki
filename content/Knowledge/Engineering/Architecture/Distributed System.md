title: Distributed System
---

Distributed systems are basically a bunch of computers trying to work together to accomplish some goal or maintain some service. All those computers and connected together through a network and will send data amongst themselves to coordinate actions.

Distributed systems are the answer to the many production problems faced by single-machine systems:
- **Horizontal scalability** — need more compute power or storage? Just add another node to the system.
- **Fault tolerance** — removing that single point of failure means some of your machines can die and the system will still be able to do its job.
- **Performance** — you can divide and conquer by running algorithms in parallel on all your nodes to make massive compute jobs complete very quickly.
- **Geographical distribution** — if you want your service to be very low latency, there is no choice but to bring the service closer to the end users.
- **Maintenance** — you can upgrade individual nodes without taking the system down.
