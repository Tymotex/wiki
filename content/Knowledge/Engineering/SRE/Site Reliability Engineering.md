**Questions**:
- How is Colossus run? Is some slave instance running on all machines?
- Colossus is said to be a cluster-wide filesystem. In data centres, a cluster is a group of racks. Does a single instance of Colossus manage exactly 1 of these physical clusters?
- What exactly *are jobs* in Borg? Are they like containerised binaries?
- Apart from RPCs providing better abstraction, why would you pick it over something like HTTP requests when you want communication between services?
- What is Chef and Puppet?

SREs are software engineers whose focus is to create *reliable*, scalable software systems. *Reliability* formally means: "the probability that [a system] will perform a required function without failure under stated conditions for a stated period of time." 

Reliability is a function of:
- *Mean time to repair (MTTR)*: time taken to restore system health.
- *Mean time to failure (MTTF)*: time taken for system to fail.

The focuses of creating reliable systems are:
- Availability — usually reported as the percentage of time the service is able to respond.
- Latency — how long it takes for a request to get a response.
- Performance
- Efficiency — in the utilisation rate of resources (using fewer computing resources).
- Change management — since changes to live systems often account for around 70% of outages, we need strategies like progressive rollouts and rollbacks.
- Monitoring — so we know whether we're meeting [[Knowledge/Engineering/SRE/SLIs, SLOs, SLAs|SLOs]].
- Emergency response
- Capacity planning

Google loosely enforces a 50/50 split between development and operations work for SREs. Coding skills are still critical.

Costs of running software after reaching production typically constitute 40-90%, meaning it's almost never the case that deployed software requires less attention from software engineers.

In the traditional development/operations split, the operations team size would scale linearly with service size. A primary focus of SRE is automating away the needs for a growing operations team and removing humans from the loop as much as possible. The SRE team size scales sublinearly with service size.

# Flashcards
- What are the 5 technologies constituting Google's storage stack?
    - They're D, Colossus, Bigtable, Spanner and Blobstore. D sits at the lowest level as a fileserver on almost every machine in a datacentre. Colossus wraps around D to create a distributed cluster filesystem and is a dependency of Bigtable (NoSQL database service) and Spanner (SQL database service).
- What is Borg?
    - A distributed 'cluster operating system' which acts as a job scheduler. You give it jobs and say they need a certain number of CPU cores and RAM, and Borg will handle the rest — picking which machines to run the job's tasks and restarting the job's tasks when it fails, etc.
