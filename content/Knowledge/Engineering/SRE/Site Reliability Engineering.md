**Questions**:
- What exactly is reliability?

SREs are software engineers whose focus is to create *reliable*, scalable software systems. *Reliability* formally means: "the probability that [a system] will perform a required function without failure under stated conditions for a stated period of time."

Costs of running software after reaching production typically constitute 40-90%, meaning it's almost never the case that deployed software requires less attention from software engineers.
