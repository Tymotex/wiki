title: "SLIs, SLOs, SLAs"

SLA, service level agreement — defines the *level of service* promised, and how the client will be compensated if that promise is broken.

SLI, service level indicator — a quantitative property of the service, e.g. availability, request latency, error rate, throughput, etc.

SLO, service level objective — a specific target value for an SLI. E.g. "the SLO for average request latency should be less than 100ms."
