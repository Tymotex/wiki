TODO: observability vs. APM vs. monitoring

Monitoring is about tracking system parameters so that the health of the system is known. 

Alerting is a part of a monitoring system. When a parameter's value exceeds a threshold, a few things might happen:
- Logged. It's non-severe, but could be important for troubleshooting.
- Generates a ticket. Needs to be looked at, but not urgent enough to immediately investigate.
- Last resort: a notification is pushed to an on-caller for timely manual intervention.
