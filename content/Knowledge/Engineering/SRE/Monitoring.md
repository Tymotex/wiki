TODO: observability vs. APM vs. monitoring

Monitoring is about tracking system parameters so that the health of the system is known. 

## Alerting
Alerting is a feature made possible by a monitoring system. When a parameter's value exceeds a threshold, a few things might happen:
- Logged. It's non-severe, but could be important for troubleshooting.
- Generates a ticket. Needs to be looked at, but not urgent enough to immediately investigate.
- Last resort: a notification is pushed to an on-caller for timely manual intervention.

> In alerting systems, optimise for high signal-to-noise ratio â€” i.e. only page on-callers when there is very little doubt that something needs to be solved both urgently and with manual intervention.

## White Box vs. Black Box Monitoring
White-box monitoring is about monitoring metrics internal to the system. Black-box monitoring is about probing the service as close as to how a client would use it.
