title: Competitive Programming

- Grind through Codeforces to get good quickly
- Finish C++ textbook.
- Read the CS4128 tips page.
- Extract notes from Notion.

1. Read the problem statement.
    - Strip the 'flavour text'.
    - Write the constraints.
    - Write the inputs and outputs.
2. Sample I/O test cases.
3. Design.
    - Estimate time complexity.
4. Implement.

Sub max n into time complexity expression and if it evaluates to less than 10 million, then it can probably clear the time limit of 1 second.

## Tips
- Use a brute force algorithm to generated expected outputs to compare against your solution.

## Questions
- Do you generally start implementing the solution when you're very confident your solution is correct? Or do you jump into implementation earlier and then figure it out as you go?
