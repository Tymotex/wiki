title: Distributed Consensus
---

*Consensus* is the process of getting groups of processes to agree on something. The point of it is to ensure data *consistency* in a distributed system â€” i.e. if a node sees a value as X, then all other nodes should also see it as X. In financial systems for example, this is critical.

Distributed consensus algorithms help distributed systems achieve consistency.
