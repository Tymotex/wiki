*CSS* (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language for describing document styling. Also see [[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/CSS Cookbook|CSS Cookbook]] and [[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/SCSS|SCSS]].

## Core
CSS files are just a sequence of **rule sets** which consists of a **[[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/CSS#Selectors|selector]]** and a **declaration block**:
![[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/assets/css-rule-set.png|400]]
CSS can be applied in a few ways:
1. Inline on an element, such as `<h1 style="color: green;">`.
2. Inside a `<style>` element.
3. Linked externally with `<link ref="stylesheet" href="...">`.

### Selectors
A *selector* is a string that targets the HTML element you want to apply some styling rules to. A selector has a *specificity* value. When two styles conflict (which often happens because of [[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/CSS#Inheritance|inheritance]], which style is chosen is based on which selector has a higher specificity.
| Selector                    | Syntax                           | Result                                                                                                          | Specificity |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Element                     | `div`                            | All `div`s.                                                                                                     | 1            | 
| Class                       | `.className`                     | All elements with `class="className"`.                                                                          | 10            |
| ID                          | `#id`                            | Element with `id="id"`                                                                                          | 1000            |
| Universal                   | `*`                              | All elements.                                                                                                   | 0            |
| Attribute                   | `div[attr]` or `div[attr="val"]` | All divs with `attr` or `attr="val"`.                                                                           | 10            |
| Pseudo-class                | `div:pseudo-class`               | All `div`s that satisfy a certain state ([[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/CSS#Pseudo-Classes\|pseudo-class]]). | 10 but depends.            |
| Pseudo-element              | `div:pseudo-element`             | The specific [[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/CSS#Pseudo-Element\|pseudo-element]] of all `div`s.              | 1.            |
| Descendant combinator       | `div p`                          | All `p`s inside a `div`.                                                                                        |             |
| Child combinator            | `div > p`                        | All `ps` that are direct children of a `div`.                                                                   |             |
| Adjacent sibling combinator | `div + p`                        | All `p`s that follow directly after a `div`.                                                                    |             |
| General sibling combinator  | `div ~ p`                        | All `p`s that follow after a `div`.                                                                             |             |

#### Inheritance
When you apply `div { color: green; }`, all children also implicitly have the rule `color: green;` set.

### Box Model
Every element follows the box model below.
![[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/assets/css-box-model.png|600]]
> `height` and `width` affect **only the inner content box**, so the actual dimensions of the element will take up more space if you have padding, border and margin. To change this, set `box-sizing: border-box` to use the [alternative CSS box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#the_alternative_css_box_model).

#### Display
Boxes are either block-level or inline-level. You change this by setting:
```css
display: block;        
display: inline;        
display: inline-block;  /* Lets you set the width, height and padding/margins. */
```
> When you do `display: flex` or `display: grid`, you're changing the *[inner display type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#inner_display_type)*, meaning that the children will behave according to the [[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/CSS#Flexbox|Flexbox]] or [[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/CSS#Grid|Grid]] specification.

Also, when you do `display: inline-flex`, you are *making the container display inline rather than block, not the children*.

### At-Rules
*At-rules* are special instructions.
| Name      | Example                                                                                                               | Description                                                                                                |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| import    | `@import "path"` or `@import url(...)`                                                                                | Brings in another stylesheet.                                                                              |
| font-face | `@font-face { font-family: "My Font"; src: url(...) format('truetype'); }`                                            | Defines a custom font.                                                                                     |
| media     | `@media screen and (min-width: 300px) { ... }`                                                                        | Executes a [[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/CSS#Media Query\|media query]] to conditionally apply styles. |
| keyframes | `@keyframes myAnim { from {...} to {...} }`. See [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes). | Defines `myAnim` which you can attach to an element by doing `animation: myAnim 1s infinite;` for example.      | 
[There are way more at-rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/At-rule).

### Pseudo-Class
Pseudo-classes represent special states of an element that you can select for using `selector:pseudo-class`. [See all of them on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes).
| Pseudo-class selector | Description                                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `:hover`              | When `mouseover` on an element. |
| `:active`             | When `mousedown`-ed on an element.                                                                        |
| `:focus`             | After an element is clicked on, or when focused on by tab.                                                                       |
| `:first-child`        | The first element in a group of siblings. Eg. `li:first-child` selects the first `li`.                                                                       |
| `:last-child`         | Like `first-child` but selecting the last.                                                                       |
| `:nth-child`          | Given a linear function of `n`, selects every `f(n)` element for `n = 0, 1, ...`. Eg. `li:nth-child(2n+3`) selects 3rd, 5th, etc.                                                                        |

### Pseudo-Element
Pseudo-elements are some specific parts of an element. They're selectable with `::pseudo-element`. [See all of them on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements).
| Pseudo-element selector | Description |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| `::before`              |             |
| `::after`               |             |
| `::first-letter`        |             | 

### Position
```css
position: static;    /* Default val. Properties: `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` have no meaning. */
          relative;  /* Like static, but the positioning properties do have meaning. */
          absolute;  /* Takes this element out of the normal document flow. 
                        It's positioned relative to the nearest `relative` ancestor. */
          fixed;     /* Like absolute, but relative to the viewport. */
          sticky;    /* Like relative and fixed. When scrolling past a sticky element,
                        it 'becomes' fixed, otherwise it stays as relative.
                        It 'sticks' around on the viewport after you've scrolled past it. */
```

### Media Query
Media queries let you conditionally apply styles based on the user's screen size ([among other things](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)). This, [[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/CSS#Flexbox|Flexbox]] and [[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/CSS#Grid|Grid]] are the main tools for implementing [responsive web designs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design). 
```css
/* If screen width >= 400px, apply style rules within. */
@media screen and (min-width: 400px) { ... }
@media (width <= 400px) { ... }                /* Alternative syntax. */

/* Clamped dimensions. */
@media screen and (min-width: 100px) and (max-width: 400px) { ... }
@media (100px <= width <= 400px) { ... }       /* Alternative syntax. */
```

**Note**: a big part of responsive design is just making elements shrink in width when the viewport shrinks in width. You can accomplish this with media queries, however it's cleaner to just something like this:
```css
width: clamp(200px, 50%, 600px);
                    ^ preferred
```
Here, an element will default to a preferred width of `50%` but will fall back to 200px if the viewport is too small.

## Flexbox
Flexbox is a layout model for getting things neatly arranged on a row or column. For layout in 2-dimension, use [[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/CSS#Grid|Grid]].
![[Knowledge/Engineering/Languages/assets/flexbox-model.png|450]]
To make a flex container, give it `display: flex`. 
```css
flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap;
justify-content: flex-start      /* Push items to left. */
                 flex-end        /* Push items to right. */
                 center          /* Push items to middle. */
                 space-between   /* Spread out with max distance between. */
                 space-around    /* Spread out with max distance around. */
align-items: flex-start          /* Anchor items to top of row. */
             flex-end            /* Anchor items to bottom of row. */
             center              /* Anchor items along a central line. */
             baseline            /* Anchor items along the text baseline. */
             stretch             /* Make items occupy full height. */
align-content: flex-start        /* Anchor to top. */ 
               flex-end          /* Anchor to bottom. */
               center            /* Anchor to middle. */
               space-between     /* Spread out rows with max distance between. */
               space-around      /* Spread out rows with max distance around. */
row-gap: 10px;
column-gap: 10px;
```

## Grid
To make a **grid container**, do `display: grid` and set the number of rows and columns with `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns`.
```css
/* 🛠️ Rows/cols of the grid. */
grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px;      /* Defines 3 columns. */
grid-template-rows:    25% 40rem 123px 10vw;   /* Defines 4 rows. You can mix units. */
                       repeat(20%, 5);         /* Expands to 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%. */
                       100px 1fr 4fr;          /* The `fr` unit takes a fraction of the available space. */
                       minmax(100px, auto) minmax(50px, auto); 
                                               /* ^ `minmax` sets the min-height of the row while allowing
                                                    larger elements to take up the space they need (auto). */

grid-template: rows / cols;                    /* Shorthand for the above 2 properties. */

grid-auto-columns: ...;     /* Specifies size of auto-generated columns. */
grid-auto-rows: ...;        /* Specifies size of auto-generated rows. */

/* 🤏 Gap sizes. */
/* Just like Flexbox's `row-gap` and `column-gap`. */
grid-row-gap: 10px;
grid-column-gap: 10px;

/* 📏 Alignment. */
/* Just like Flexbox, Grid has `justify-content`, `align-items`, `align-content`.
   Grid additionally has `justify-items` that Flexbox ignores. */
justify-content: start;          /* Behaves analogously to Flexbox. Aligns along x-axis. */
                 end;
                 center;
                 space-around;
                 space-between;
                 stretch;
align-content:   start;          /* Behaves analogously to Flexbox. Like `justify-content`, */
                 end;            /* but along the y-axis.                                   */
                 center;
                 space-around;
                 space-between;
                 stretch;
align-items:     stretch;        /* Behaves analogously to Flexbox. Aligns along y-axis. */
                 start;
                 end;
                 center;
                 baseline;
justify-items:   start;          /* Like `align-items`, but aligns along the x-axis. */
                 end;
                 center;
                 stretch;
```

Any direct child element of the grid container is a **grid item** and can be positioned on the grid using the following properties:
```css
/* Positioning in the grid. */
grid-column-start: n;    /* Pushes the item to the n-th column (starting from n = 1, not n = 0) */
grid-column-end: m;     
grid-row-start: n;
grid-row-end: m
              span l;    /* Instead of specifying the start/end with an index, you can specify how many cells are spanned. */

grid-area: row1 / col1 / row2 / col2;   /* Shorthand for the above 4 properties, spanning an area on the grid. */
```

## CSS Code Style
Some simple guidelines for writing maintainable CSS code. See [MaintainableCSS](https://maintainablecss.com/).
- Prefer semantic class names.
    ```html
    <!-- Semantic -->
    <div class="searchResults">
    <!-- Not semantic -->
    <div class="red pull-down m-2">
    ```
    > "... use values that describe the nature of the content, rather than values that describe the desired presentation of the content"
- Stick with a naming convention like this:
    ```css
    .module[-component][-state] { ... }

    /* Examples: */
    .breadcrumbs-link { ... }
    .breadcrumbs-link-disabled { ... }
    .breadcrumbs-separator { ... }
    ```
- Avoid using IDs just as hooks for styling.
- Avoid undoing styling rules, eg. resetting styles provided by bootstrap or by another one of your CSS rules elsewhere.
- Write comments as if you were documenting regular program source code, *especially if you write rules that are meant to solve an issue*. CSS is usually a huge pain for people, so please remember to help your future self, and especially others working with your code.
