Data centers are very large physical buildings that are dedicated to housing the computers that form the [[Knowledge/Engineering/Cloud/Cloud Computing|cloud]].
- A data center's location is strategically chosen based on proximity to users (so as to minimise *round-trip times*, and therefore latency), proximity to workers, availability of land and electrical infrastructure, low natural disaster risks, and so on.
