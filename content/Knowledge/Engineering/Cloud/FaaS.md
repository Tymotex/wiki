*FaaS* (functions as-a-service) is a class of [[Knowledge/Engineering/Cloud/Cloud Computing|cloud computing]] services which let you run a bit of code on a server somewhere in response to events or HTTP requests. The pay-as-you-go pricing is great when you don't want or need a [[Knowledge/Engineering/DevOps/Virtual Machines|VM]] running 24/7 that only occasionally needs to execute some routine. Cloud vendors like AWS or Google Cloud provide *FaaS* platforms like AWS Lambda and [[Knowledge/Engineering/Technologies/Google Cloud#Cloud Run|Cloud Run]] which can execute your code in response to events.
