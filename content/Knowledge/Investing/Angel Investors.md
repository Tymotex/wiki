Angel investors are just really rich people who are willing to lend their own money to fund a startup's initial venture. Startups often perfer angel investors over other forms of funding because they generally get better terms.

Angel investors are considered the opposite of [[Knowledge/Investing/Venture Capital|venture capitalists]], since they're focused on business viability than helping to start a business.
