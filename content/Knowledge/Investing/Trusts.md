Trusts are legal structures where a **trustor** gives the right to the **trustee** to hold their assets for the **beneficiaries** of the trust. The assets are distributed according to the trustor's instructions and have legal protection.

Trusts are frequently exploited for investment and business purposes. They're also a method to protect and distribute assets to specific people after the owner's death.
