REITs give you exposure to the property market without needing to maintain properties themselves and without a huge amount of initial capital.

There are different 'flavours' of REITS:
- Residential REITs
- Retail REITs
- Office REITs
- Industrial REITs (warehouses and factories)
- Mortgage REITs
... and so on.
