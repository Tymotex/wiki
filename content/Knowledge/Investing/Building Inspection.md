> "Latin for 'Let the buyer beware', *caveat emptor* is the general rule of law for the sale of real estate in Australia. A vendor doesn't have to disclose her property's faults  it's your responsibility to know exactly what you're buying."

Always inspect yourself, but also get a formal report done by specialists. Do not cheap out on formal inspections. They can score you a list of bargaining chips in negotiations and prevent unexpected costs later on.
