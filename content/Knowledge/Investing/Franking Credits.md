title: Franking Credits
---

**Franking credits** (also called *imputation credits*) are to prevent double taxation (once on company profits, then again on the capital gains when those profits are distributed to shareholders).
- You only get franking credits when investing in Australian companies.

For example, suppose Woolworths makes a profit $1 billion before-tax and is taxed 30% of it. The remaining $700 million is distributed to shareholders as dividends, who then would have to pay tax on the capital gains, hence double taxation. In this case, we say there is a $300 million franking credit, which can be claimed by shareholders, resulting in a tax refund (if their marginal tax rate is less than 30%) or paying differing tax rate (if the marginal tax rate exceeds 30%).
