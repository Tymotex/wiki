title: Franking Credits
---

**Franking credits** are to prevent double taxation (once on company profits, then again on the capital gains when those profits are distributed to shareholders).

For example, suppose Woolworths makes a profit $1 billion before-tax and is taxed 30% of it. The remaining $700 million is distributed to shareholders as dividends, who then would have to pay tax on the capital gains, hence double taxation. In this case, we say there is a $300 million franking credit, which can be claimed by shareholders, resulting in a tax refund or paying differing tax rate if the marginal tax rate exceeds 30% (in this example).
