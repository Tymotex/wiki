title: Franking Credits
---

**Franking credits** are to prevent double taxation.

For example, suppose Woolworths makes a profit $1 billion before-tax and is taxed 10% of it. The remaining $900 million is distributed to shareholders as dividends, who then would have to pay tax on the capital gains, hence double taxation. In this case, we say there is a $100 million franking credit, which can be claimed, resulting in a tax refund.
