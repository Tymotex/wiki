An *investment portfolio* is just a set of assets, typically [[Knowledge/Investing/Securities|securities]] like [[Knowledge/Investing/Stocks|stocks]] and [[Knowledge/Economics/macroeconomics/Bonds|bonds]], and cash, but it can also include real estate, commodities, etc. What's inside your portfolio, or in other words, what you *asset allocation mixes* are, depends on your own *risk tolerance*, which depends largely on your age and financial goals. 

### Diversification
*Diversification* is just about investing in a set of assets with varying levels of risk/return rather than fully investing in one type of asset. You can also diversify *within* an asset class. For example, when investing in shares, to diversify means to have a share portfolio spanning several companies than just 1 or a few companies.
