An *investment portfolio* is just a set of assets, typically [[Knowledge/Investing/Securities|securities]] like [[Knowledge/Investing/Stocks|stocks]] and [[Knowledge/Economics/macroeconomics/Bonds|bonds]], and cash, but it can also include real estate, commodities, etc. What's inside your portfolio, or in other words, what you *asset allocation mixes* are, depends on your own *risk tolerance*, which depends largely on your age and financial goals. 

## Rebalancing
Rebalancing is about restoring your portfolio back to the asset allocations that you originally intended for it to be at.

For example, if you had a 50/50 split between stocks and bonds, and after a year, due to the differing gains/loss that split becomes 60/40, then rebalancing involves bringing it back to 50/50. If you were to *not* rebalance, then you'd be more affected by a stock market crash.

You accomplish rebalancing by:
- Buying more of the underperformer (called *accumulation*).
- Selling the overperformer (called *distribution*).
    - Also note that selling *realises* capital gains, which is **less tax efficient** because you no longer can earn compounded money on the would-be delayed tax payment.
