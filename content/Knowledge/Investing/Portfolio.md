An *investment portfolio* is just a set of assets, typically [[Knowledge/Investing/Securities|securities]] like [[Knowledge/Investing/Stocks|stocks]] and [[Knowledge/Economics/macroeconomics/Bonds|bonds]], and cash, but it can also include real estate, commodities, etc. What's inside your portfolio, or in other words, what you *asset allocation mixes* are, depends on your own *risk tolerance*, which depends largely on your age and financial goals. 

## Rebalancing
TODO. I think it goes like this: if you had a 50/50 split between VAS and VTS, and after a year, due to the differing gains/loss that split becomes 40/60, then rebalancing involves bringing it back to 50/50, eg. by buying more of the underperformer (called *accumulation*) or selling the overperformer (called *distribution*). Also note that selling realises capital gains, which is less tax efficient â€” you no longer can earn compounded money on the would-be delayed tax payment. Apparently rebalancing once every 1-2 years is best, and more frequently can apparently make things worse.
