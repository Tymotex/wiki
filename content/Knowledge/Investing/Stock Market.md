> The stock market is the greatest opportunity machine ever created.

The *stock market*, also called the *share market*, is the buy/sell [[Knowledge/Economics/microeconomics/Market|market]] for [[Knowledge/Investing/Stocks|stocks]]. Even though it’s called ‘stock market’, you can also trade other securities like [[Knowledge/Investing/Exchange Traded Funds|ETFs]], corporate [[Knowledge/Economics/macroeconomics/Bonds|bonds]], [[Knowledge/Investing/Derivatives|derivatives]] based on stocks, commodities, currencies and bonds in the stock market. To buy stocks, you need a *broker*.

### Understanding the Stock Market
The basis of the stock market's existence is the incentive for companies to acquire funding to execute their ideas and the incentive for individuals with money (called investors) to invest and benefit from the success of those companies.

As a company becomes more profitable, its stocks increase in value (demand). The reverse also happens.

The profitability of a company can fluctuate massively — due to material shortages, leadership changes, bad publicity, new regulations, etc. 


The stock market is an example of something closely resembling a [[Knowledge/Economics/microeconomics/Market#Perfectly Competitive Markets|perfectly competitive market]]. Share prices are determined by [[Knowledge/Economics/microeconomics/Supply and Demand|supply and demand]].

People buy shares through *brokers*.

The stock market is a [complex adaptive system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system). Unlike in the context of maths and science, you can't predict how the overall system behaves just by knowing how each part of the system behave.

### History of the Stock Market

### Macroeconomics
Macroeconomic events and variables have a huge effect on stock market performance.

#### Investing During High Inflation
A favourable company to invest in during inflationary periods has two properties:
1. The freedom to jack up or fine-tune their prices without significantly dropping market share values. Eg. Apple, since they have a unique competitve advantage, can freely increase their prices without huge consequences to their share price. People generally won't try to substitute away to other competitors.
2.  Low working capital. In other words, the company should be able to generate a lot of cash from little input and have a scalable business model. Eg. Meta can just increase ad frequency to generate more cash, while Ford would have to invest in new factories and equipment.

#### Interest Rates
At lower [[Knowledge/Economics/macroeconomics/Interest|interest rates]], stock market prices will more easily rise (I think. Need a source and explanation for this).

At higher interest rates, it's harder for stock prices to rise.
