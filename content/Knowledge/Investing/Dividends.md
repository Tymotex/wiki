A dividend is a payment distributed by the company to [[Knowledge/Investing/Stocks|shareholders]], usually every 3 months. Many companies are not required to pay dividends to shareholders and so they will choose to reinvest it back into the company. 

There are *dividend reinvestment plans* which automatically use the cash payment you'd usually get to buy more of the company's stock.
