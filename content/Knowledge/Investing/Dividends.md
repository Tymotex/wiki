A dividend is a payment distributed by the company to [[Knowledge/Investing/Stocks|shareholders]], usually every 3 months. Many companies are not required to pay dividends to shareholders and so they will choose to reinvest it back into the company. 

There are *dividend reinvestment plans* which automatically use the cash payment you'd usually get to buy more of the company's stock.

Note: dividend payments reduce the price of the stock.
> Collecting dividends is also no safer than selling down your portfolio, which is a common misconception. A non-reinvested dividend is literally a withdrawal from your portfolio, except you don't have control over when it happens[\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/fiaustralia/comments/jtcunb/new_to_fire_and_investing_start_here/).
