title: Stock Brokers
---

To buy and sell assets such as shares, ETFs, options, futures, currency, and so on, you must do it through a broker. Originally, brokerage was conducted by humans, but now online brokers can accomplish the same task.

You make an investment decision (e.g. to buy Alphabet Inc. stocks), then dispatch *orders* to the broker for them to execute, which is where you pay them a fee/commission. They do not inform your investing decisions.

To fulfil orders yourself is complex and time-consuming, hence the existence of the middleman (brokers).
