Options are [[Knowledge/Investing/Derivatives|derivatives]], or contracts, where two parties agree to buy/sell each other an asset at a **specific price at a specific date**, just like [[Knowledge/Investing/Futures|futures]], except that the buyer has the choice of exercising the purchase opportunity, hence the name 'option'. The seller however is obligated to sell if the buyer chooses to buy.
