Options are [[Knowledge/Investing/Derivatives|derivatives]], or contracts, where two parties agree to buy/sell each other an asset at a **specific price (known as the 'strike price') at a specific date**, just like [[Knowledge/Investing/Futures|futures]], except that the buyer has the choice of exercising the purchase opportunity, hence the name 'option'. The seller however is obligated to sell if the buyer chooses to buy.

The buyer pays a premium for the right to buy at the strike price, locking in the *opportunity* to decide to buy it at that price in the future.
- **Call options**, or just 'calls', let the buyer buy the asset at the strike price in a specific timeframe.
- **Put options**, or just 'puts', let the buyer sell the asset at the strike price in a specific timeframe.
