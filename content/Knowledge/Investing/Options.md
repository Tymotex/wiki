Options are [[Knowledge/Investing/Derivatives|derivatives]], or contracts, where two parties agree to buy/sell each other an asset at a **specific price at a specific date**, just like [[Knowledge/Investing/Futures|futures]], except that the buyer can back out of the agreement, hence the name 'option'.
