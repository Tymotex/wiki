title: Landlording
---

It's recommended to hire a property manager to act as landlord for you if you only own 1 or 2 investment properties. The fee paid to them is usually more cost-effective than you investing your own time and energy into learning the tenancy laws and management techniques for landlording.

Consider opportunity costs carefully. DIY management is usually not worth it as a high-income earner.

## Tenancy Laws
This is not an area you can afford to trial-and-error. You have to get legal compliance correct the first time and all the times after that.
