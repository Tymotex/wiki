A *stock exchange* is a centralised place for corporations, governments, investors and traders that has the infrastructure to facilitate the trading of stocks (and other financial instruments such as commodities and bonds). NASDAQ, NYSE and [[Knowledge/Investing/ASX|ASX]] are examples of *stock exchanges*. Note that in stock exchanges, you're only trading with existing shareholders, not the company itself (usually).

Electronic stock exchanges such as the Nasdaq connects buyers and sellers through *electronic communication networks* (ECNs) and do not require a centralised location for buyers and sellers to meet.
