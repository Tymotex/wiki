*The ASX's (Australian Stock Exchange) physical building.*

A *stock exchange* is a centralised place for corporations, governments, investors and traders that has the infrastructure to facilitate the trading of stocks (and other financial instruments such as commodities and bonds). NASDAQ, NYSE and [[Knowledge/Investing/ASX|ASX]] are examples of *stock exchanges*. Note that in stock exchanges, you're only trading with existing shareholders, not the company itself (usually).
- Electronic stock exchanges such as the Nasdaq connects buyers and sellers through *electronic communication networks* (ECNs) and do not require a centralised location for buyers and sellers to meet.
- NYSE and NASDAQ are the two largest stock exchanges. When we say 'largest', we just mean largest based on total [[Knowledge/Investing/Market Capitalisation|market capitalisation]] of all the companies listed on the exchange.
