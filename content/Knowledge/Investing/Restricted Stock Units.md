title: Restricted Stock Units
---

Restricted stock units (RSUs) are [[Knowledge/Investing/Stocks|stocks]] given as part of your compensation by your employer.
- Ownership of RSUs is transferred from your employer to you based on a [[Knowledge/Investing/Restricted Stock Units|vesting plan]]. Once 'vested', those shares are basically normal assets under your ownership â€” you're free to hold or sell as you please.
- There are important things to know about how they're [[Knowledge/Investing/Restricted Stock Units|taxed]]. The main difference is that the entire value of the stocks are considered your income.

## Vesting
TODO.

## GSUs
GSU is basically a Google internal name for restricted stock units. I think the vast majority of things below here apply for restricted stock units in general.

- **FMV** â€” fair market value, â€œan asset's estimated value if it were sold today in the current market."
- â€˜Awardsâ€™ == â€˜grantsâ€™.
- Once a GSU is said to be â€˜vestedâ€™, it is entirely yours and Google cannot take it away from you. A vested share is exactly the same as if you were to have independently went out and bought the share yourself.
- For tax purposes you need to care about:
    - When your GSU vests.
- Annual refresh grant
    - This is something you may or may not receive yearly. It depends on your performance, future potential and how important your role is.
    - Annual refresh grants are calculated as: target grant * (individual) grant multiplier, followed by discretionary adjustment by manager.
- Stock splitâ€¦ TODO
    - The total value of your holdings is unchanged.
    - TODO: [](https://www.forex.com/en-us/news-and-analysis/google-stock-split-2022/#:~:text=When%20is%20the%20Google%20stock,they%20held%20before%20that%20date)[https://www.forex.com/en-us/news-and-analysis/google-stock-split-2022/#:~:text=When](https://www.forex.com/en-us/news-and-analysis/google-stock-split-2022/#:~:text=When) is the Google stock,they held before that date.
        - There is no tax implications arising from this split.
- Award grants are given based on value of GSUs, rather than number of GSUs. You are promised a value, not a fixed number of GSUs.
    - GSUs are rounded up. E.g. if you are meant to be given 3.7 GSUs, you will actually get 4 GSUs.
    - How many GSUs you get depends on the average closing price of GOOG in the month before the grant.
- Awardâ€™s vesting frequency date is different for some people. For you, you can expect 1 grant every month. Others might get it quarterly or half-yearly.
    - No matter how frequent your grants are, theyâ€™ll be distributed equally across 4 years. Always 4 years for some reason.
- Grant dateâ€¦ TODO.

go/prosper is a purely internal tool.

- This is not a place to get official documents for tax purposes. For official documents, start from your brokerage account dashboard.
    
    - go/stockstatement should show you all the data you need for tax. Itâ€™ll route to Morgan Stanley even if you are on Charles Schwab.
- Delta â€” the difference between the projected value of the shares that will vest or the value of shares that vested when compared to the value at grant.
    
- W8-BEN must be filled out for non-US citizens, which is true for you. Itâ€™s used to determine whether you are a U.S. taxpayer.
    
    - Must be filled every 3 years.
    - Selling without it filled out will result in some money being withheld from you.

Selling shares:

- You can only sell shares within an open trading window (go/tradingwindow). This is a way to circumvent insider trading (the trading window is chosen to be far from the release of Googleâ€™s financial data)
    
- You sell by placing a â€˜Limitâ€™ or â€˜Marketâ€™ trade on your brokerage site.
    
- You can choose to opt into go/etp which will allow shares to be sold even in the closing window, but the catch is that you have to commit to selling it in advance.
    
    - You can only enrol in this at a specific time each year.
- TODO: what are ESS statements? (Employee share scheme)
    
- TODO: Is GSU subject to CGT? But itâ€™s my income, not investment ðŸ˜Ÿ

## Tax
