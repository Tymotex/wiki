title: Currency Risk
---

Currency risk covers two scenarios:
- When the home currency appreciates but your portfolio is fully international, then that reduces your portfolio's value.
- Likewise, when the home currency depreciates but your portfolio is fully domestic, then that reduces your portfolio's value.

One suggested way to minimise currency risk is to split fairly (e.g. 50/50) across domestic and international equities (e.g. investing in an Australian index fund and a US index fund). Deciding how to split the international/domestic allocation is a tradeoff between *concentration risk* and *currency risk*.
- Another option is to have *AUD-hedged* international equities which reduces currency and concentration risk, however note that the hedging could reduce returns or even increase volatility[\*](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/personalising-your-aud-to-non-aud-allocation/).
- Consider your other assets as well. If you own investment properties in Australia, then you can afford to have a more predominantly international unhedged share portfolio.
