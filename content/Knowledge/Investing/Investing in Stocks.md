> "It’s important to educate yourself about the economy, interest rates, exchange rates and government policy, and understand how these factors may affect a company’s performance, says [the Australian Government’s MoneySmart website](http://www.moneysmart.gov.au/)." — [CommBank](https://www.commbank.com.au/articles/investing/share-investing-for-absolute-beginners.html)

Share price is heavily tied to the company's future outlook.

MoneySmart recommends asking questions like:
-   Will the goods and services this company provides be in demand in the future?
-   Are there opportunities for the company to grow?
-   Who are the company’s competitors and are they in a strong position?

Sources such as a company’s annual report, as well as its yearly and half-yearly financial results statements, can be good places to find relevant information.
