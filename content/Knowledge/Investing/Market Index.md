A *market index* is a value published by a financial data company that's meant to broadly capture the value of some section of a market. 

An *index*, in most stats, economics and finance contexts, is just a representative value of an asset in a set of assets. *Indexes* are meant to accurately summarise the state of some market by picking out parts of the stock market and producing a value, usually by simply taking the mathematical weighted average. Indexes are created to serve as a simple indicator/benchmark of stock market performance that provide a useful summary at a glance. Note that there are indexes that also cover non-stock assets such as gold, oil, currencies, etc.

To be clear with terminology, you can't invest in an *index*, but you *can* invest in an [[Knowledge/Investing/Index Funds|index fund]] that mirrors an index such that an $n\%$ increase in the index value will mean a corresponding $n\%$ increase in your balance.
