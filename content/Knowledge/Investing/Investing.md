An *investment* is the purchase of an asset or commodity with the expectation of it producing income for you or appreciating in value. *Investing* is the set of theory and practices around making smart investments that aid you in meeting your financial goals.

1. Understand the power of compounding. Start early and invest regularly.
2. Understand [[Knowledge/Investing/Portfolio#Diversification|diversification]].
3. Only invest in what you understand. 
4. Would you want to be an owner of that business? 

> The main difference between a *trader* and an *investor* is how long they hold the asset. Traders focus on capitalising on short-term trends.


### Defensive vs. Growth Investments
Investments are generally divided into two types: *defensive* and *growth*. Defensive investments are lower risk and tend to protect your wealth rather than grow it. Growth investments are riskier and tend to grow your wealth rather than preserve it. Usually, bonds are considered defensive assets while stocks are considered growth assets.

Prefer defensive investments if you need to meet shorter-term financial goals, such as saving for a home deposit in 2 years, or to reduce the volatility of your portfolio [(source)](https://moneysmart.gov.au/how-to-invest/choose-your-investments).

### Tax
Any income you get from your investments in the form of savings interest, dividends (even if it's reinvested as part of dividend reinvestment plan), rental income, capital gains (from property, shares, crypto), etc. is taxed at your [marginal tax rate](https://moneysmart.gov.au/income-tax/income-tax-calculator). Investment income must be included in your [[Knowledge/Personal Finance/Tax Return|tax return]]. Costs involved with buying, holding and selling an investment asset is tax deductible. Even the interest accrued on a loan you take to invest in something is also tax deductible. If you pay management fees to a mutual fund or pay for investment advice, those are also tax deductible.

A *tax-effective* investment is one where the tax you pay on the investment income is less than your marginal tax rate. Salary-sacrificed [[Knowledge/Personal Finance/Superannuation|super]] contributions are considered *tax-effective* since it gets taxed at a low 15%, up to a point ([source](https://moneysmart.gov.au/how-to-invest/investing-and-tax)).

### Buying, Holding and Selling Shares

Track your share purchases and the market value of the shares at the time you buy them because you can claim some [[Knowledge/Investing/Investing#Tax|tax deductions]] on them.


### Active vs. Passive Investing
*Active* management involves monitoring the performance of an investment portfolio and making decisions about whether to buy, sell or hold and asset. It aims to 'beat the market' by adopting certain investing strategies and does not support the [[Knowledge/Investing/Efficient Market Hypothesis|efficient market hypothesis]] which implies it's not possible to 'beat the market' over the long run.

*Passive* management, known as 'index investing', is about mirroring a [[Knowledge/Investing/Market Index|market index]] and is usually associated with [[Knowledge/Investing/Index Funds|index funds]] and [[Knowledge/Investing/Exchange Traded Funds|ETFs]]. They help *diversify* you across the whole part of the market.

Whether active or passive investment outperforms the other in the long term is an ongoing debate.

Warren Buffett, the world's most successful active *value investor*, recommends most people to pursue passive investing over attempting to do active investing yourself because passive investing removes the irrationality from buy/sell decisions that you're victim to.

### Value vs. Growth Investing
*Value investing* is about being able to see the intrinsic value of something, then buying that thing when its priced lower than the intrinsic value. *Value investors* believe the stock market to overreact to good or bad news and set prices that aren't reflective of the true value of a stock, which gives rise to an opportunity to profit.

Put simply, if you know the *true* value of jewelry, and you find some overlooked cheap jewelry in a garage sale, then you would obviously exploit the opportunity.

*Growth investing*, on the other hand, is about investing in the stock of smaller companies whose earnings are expected to climb at a much higher rate than established companies.

### Stocks vs. Bonds
Stocks represent ownership, bonds represent loans. Each have their own pros/cons, but in general: bonds are lower risk and have lower returns. When you're young and don't have strict target dates for financial goals, just go for stocks and allocate a greater percentage of your portfolio to bonds when you require more certainty about your investment returns.

### Capital Gains
TODO.

TODO: *Capital gains tax*.


### Investing Strategies

> Random youtube comment: For beginners, i would go 95-97% funds / etfs and 3%-5% a stock you like. Gets you into the habit of researching stocks and looking at daily life and what companies impact you.


#### Index Funds
It's widely recommended that most investors should just make monthly investments ([[Knowledge/Investing/Investing#Dollar-Cost Averaging DCA|dollar-cost averaging]]) to a low-cost [[Knowledge/Investing/Index Funds|index fund]].
> "Most investors, both institutional and individual, will find that the best way to own common stocks is through an index fund that charges minimal fees. Those following this path are sure to beat the net results (after fees and expenses) delivered by the great majority of investment professionals" — Warren Buffett's 1996 Letter to Shareholders.
- In Australia in year 2022, index funds in the S&P/ASX 200 outperformed $\approx 70\text{-}80\%$ of actively managed funds run by professionals.

Jack Bogle recommends to always commit to investing in an index fund, even if they're priced at all-time highs and you're convinced that they're overvalued. 

![[Knowledge/Investing/assets/s&p-investing-in-local-peaks.png|500]]

> "Never think you know more than the market does." — Jack Bogle.

Historically, the only time investing in index funds has not worked has been when people cave into their emotions and deviate from their commitment to dollar-cost average invest into an index fund and attempt to beat the market on their own. Just stay the course.

#### Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)
TODO.

DCA is about regularly putting money into an investment pursuit over the long term, rather than chucking in a huge sum at 'the right time'.

Warren Buffett recommends to do this and commit to it for the long term.

Dollar-cost averaging protects you from making irrational decisions and the effects of large market fluctuations.

#### The Buffett/Munger Approach
1. Understand the business.
2. Check for a durable competitive advantage.
3. Management has integrity and talent.
4. Ensure a marign of safety. 

TODO: Explain each.

#### Patience
> "You don't make money when you buy and you don't make money when you sell. You make money when you wait." — Charlie Munger.

For active investors, be patient. For passive investors, proceed to regularly invest as normal.

#### Emotions

Avoid headlines.

### Macroeconomic Effects
Macroeconomic events and variables have a huge effect on stock market performance.

#### Investing During High Inflation
> "Like virginity, a stable price level seems capable of maintenance, but not of restoration" — Warren Buffett describing inflation and how escalating prices are permanent.

A favourable company to invest in during inflationary periods has two properties:
1. The freedom to jack up or fine-tune their prices without significantly dropping market share values. Eg. Apple, since they have a unique competitve advantage, can freely increase their prices without huge consequences to their share price. People generally won't try to substitute away to other competitors.
2.  Low working capital. In other words, the company should be able to generate a lot of cash from little input and have a scalable business model. Eg. Meta can just increase ad frequency to generate more cash, while Ford would have to invest in new factories and equipment.

#### Interest Rates
At lower [[Knowledge/Economics/macroeconomics/Interest|interest rates]], stock market prices will more easily rise (I think. Need a source and explanation for this).

At higher interest rates, it's harder for stock prices to rise.
