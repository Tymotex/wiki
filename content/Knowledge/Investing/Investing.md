An *investment* is the purchase of an asset or commodity with the expectation of it producing income for you or appreciating in value. *Investing* is the set of theory and practices around making smart investments that aid you in meeting your financial goals.

1. Understand the power of compounding. Start early and invest regularly.
2. Understand [[Knowledge/Investing/Portfolio#Diversification|diversification]].
3. Only invest in what you understand. 
4. Would you want to be an owner of that business? 

> The main difference between a *trader* and an *investor* is how long they hold the asset. Traders focus on capitalising on short-term trends.

## Stock Market
### Investing Strategies
- Go 98% ETFs or index funds and 2% individual stocks. This gets you into the habit of researching stocks.
- Avoid all emotional decision-making.
    > "You don't make money when you buy and you don't make money when you sell. You make money when you wait." â€” Charlie Munger.

## Bond Market
### Stocks vs. Bonds
In general: bonds are lower risk but have lower returns than stocks. When you're young and don't have strict target dates for financial goals, just go for stocks and allocate a greater percentage of your portfolio to bonds when you require more certainty about your investment returns.
