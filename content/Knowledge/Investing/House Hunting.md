Consider hiring a *buyer's advocate*, an expert to help you evaluate the potential home and negotiate its price.

Location is the greatest factor.

1. Suburb safety.
2. Location.
    - Distance from the CBD.
    - Vicinity to:
        - Public transport.
        - Shops
        - Schools 
        - Parks
        - ... and important services such as hospitals.
3. Are development plans for this area?
4. Rental yields and demand
    - Vacancy rate.
5. Land size.
5. Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, parking spots.
6. Community.

## Zones TODO

Apparently my house is R2, low density residential


## Pitfalls
- Noise from motorways or train lines.

## Determining Market Value
Real estate agents give price guides, but you should be skeptical.
- Look at the most recently sold prices of similar properties in the same area.
- Ask your mortgage broker for the CoreLogic report.
    - Or use [ING propertyvalue.com](https://www.propertyvalue.com.au/ing) to get free CoreLogic reports.
- Use an online property value estimator.
