title: Value versus Growth Investing
---

*Value investing* is about being able to see the intrinsic value of something, then buying that thing when its priced lower than the intrinsic value. *Value investors* believe the stock market to overreact to good or bad news and set prices that aren't reflective of the true value of a stock, which gives rise to an opportunity to profit.

Put simply, if you know the *true* value of jewelry, and you find some overlooked cheap jewelry in a garage sale, then you would obviously exploit the opportunity.

*Growth investing*, on the other hand, is about investing in the stock of smaller companies whose earnings are expected to climb at a much higher rate than established companies.
