title: Market Capitalisation
---

*Market capitalisation* (or just *market cap*) is the total market value of a company's outstanding shares. This is a good estimator of the size of a company.
- *Small-cap* is $\lt \$2 \text{ billion}$
- *Mid-cap* is $\geq \$2 \text{ billion}$
- *Large-cap* is $\geq \$10 \text{ billion}$

Generally, the greater the market capitalisation, the less risky an investment is.
