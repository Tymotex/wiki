title: Market Capitalisation
---

*Market capitalisation* (or just *market cap*) is the total market value of a company's outstanding shares. This is a good estimator of the size of a company.
- *Small-cap* is $\lt \$2 \text{ billion}$
- *Mid-cap* is $\geq \$2 \text{ billion}$
- *Large-cap* is $\geq \$10 \text{ billion}$

Generally:
- The greater the market capitalisation, the less risky an investment is. 
- The lesser the market capitalisation, the lower the trading volume and the less liquid an investment is (since there are fewer buyers and sellers).
