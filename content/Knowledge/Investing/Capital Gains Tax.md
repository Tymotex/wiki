title: Capital Gains Tax
---

Any income you get from your investments in the form of savings interest, [[Knowledge/Investing/Dividends|dividends]] (even if it's reinvested as part of dividend reinvestment plan), rental income, capital gains (from property, shares, crypto), etc. is taxed at your [marginal tax rate](https://moneysmart.gov.au/income-tax/income-tax-calculator). Investment income must be included in your [[Knowledge/Personal Finance/Tax Return|tax return]]. Costs involved with buying, holding and selling an investment asset is tax deductible. Even the interest accrued on a loan you take to invest in something is also tax deductible. If you pay management fees to a mutual fund or pay for investment advice, those are also tax deductible.

A *tax-effective* investment is one where the tax you pay on the investment income is less than your marginal tax rate. Salary-sacrificed [[Knowledge/Personal Finance/Superannuation|super]] contributions are considered *tax-effective* since it gets taxed at a low 15%, up to a point ([source](https://moneysmart.gov.au/how-to-invest/investing-and-tax)).
