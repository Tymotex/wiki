**Stocks** represent pieces of official ownership, called 'ownership equity', of a business. They are a type of [[Knowledge/Investing/Securities|security]] and are traded in the [[Knowledge/Investing/Stock Market|stock market]].
- Your ownership is quantifiable as: $\frac{\text{Company X stocks that you have}}{\text{Total Company X stocks}} \times 100\%$.

**Shares** are the *smallest denomination* of a company's stock. They're *units of stocks*. Companies will usually have millions or billions of total shares, called 'outstanding shares'.

Owning shares in a company makes you a **shareholder** of that company. Shareholders get to vote and sometimes get a portion of the business' profits, called [[Knowledge/Investing/Dividends|Dividends]]. If the company *becomes more profitable* between the time you bought the shares and the time you sell it, you'll have [[Knowledge/Investing/Investing#Capital Gains|capital gains]] on the shares.

Your ownership gives you voting power in meetings and elections within the company. Generally, 1 share held gives you 1 vote, however this is set by the company, who can also split off shares into different classes where one class' shares have a greater weighting than another in terms of voting power.

## Why do companies sell stocks?
When companies choose to list themselves on a *stock exchange* like the Nasdaq, they're provided with [[Knowledge/Economics/macroeconomics/Liquidity|liquidity]] and a means to acquire money for capital investment. The tradeoff is that they're subject to greater expenses and tighter regulation.

To grow your company into an *empire* requires you to have access to a huge amount of capital, ie. money to invest in your ventures and operations. When a company can attract investors by listing themselves on the stock market, they'll be able to lease an office, hire more people, get more equipment, pursue more marketing efforts, etc.

An alternative way for companies to raise capital is to sell [[Knowledge/Economics/macroeconomics/Bonds|bonds]]. Many companies will opt to sell both stocks and bonds. The act of selling shares is called *equity financing* and the act of selling bonds is called *debt financing*. For most startups, they simply don't have the assets to really sustainably meet debt payments, so equity financing is the preferred route, where they don't have to pay as much as they grow.

Companies can also acquire funding from [[Knowledge/Investing/Venture Capital|venture capital]] firms or [[Knowledge/Investing/Angel Investors|angel investors]].

## Why Are Stocks Called 'Stocks'
In medieval Europe, people recorded debts by etching marks on tally sticks and splitting them. When split, the stick would have a very unique pattern of splitting that was hard to tamper with. The longer part was called the 'stock', given to the lender, the shorter part was called the 'foil', given to the borrower. These sticks were considered legal proofs of transactions for hundreds of years until the 1800s.

## Stock, Shares and Equities
In everyday conversation, all 3 are the same. Formally, however, there are differences:
- *Stock*: a representation of ownership in a company.
- *Share*: the smallest denomination of company stock.
- *Equity*: generally, it's the ownership of assets that have liabilities associated with them. For example, a *home equity* is the difference between the market value and the remaining balance owed on a mortage.

The *stock market*, *share market* and *equity market* all refer to the same thing.

## Why do stocks have any value?
[If a stock doesn't pay dividends, then why is the stock worth anything?](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/51976/if-a-stock-doesnt-pay-dividends-then-why-is-the-stock-worth-anything)

A share has value based on the expectation of future dividends or a future acquisition, both of which depend on a **company's profitability**. When someone buys your shares, they're paying for this expectation.

A company that reinvests their profits instead of distributing it to shareholders can compound their growth.

#### How do companies decide how many 'total shares' there are? Is there a difference between having a total number of shares of 1 million vs. 1 billion?

### Common Shares vs. Preferred Shares
Shares are usually either *common shares* and *preferred shares*. Preferred shareholders get priority over common shareholders when receiving dividends and the assets if the company [[Knowledge/Investing/Stocks#Liquidation|liquidates]].

### Liquidation
Liquidation is when a business dies. When liquidated, a business' assets are distributed to shareholders proportionally based on how many shares each of them own.

Businesses die when they become *insolvent*, which means that their liquid assets
