## How to buy a house
1. **[[Knowledge/Investing/House Hunting|Find a house]]**. Expect the search to take months.
2. **Save money** for a deposit and other expected costs.
    - â‰¥20% of a target property's value to avoid paying the lender's mortgage insurance (LMI).
    - Stamp duty, which needs to be paid within 30 days of settlement.
    - Conveyancing fees. 
3. Find the best home loan rate and get a **pre-approval**. This should be the first step you actually do in practice since a pre-approval confirms your price range.
    - A mortgage broker can help identify home loans. They're usually free for you to consult, however they earn a commission from the lenders.
        - You will need to provide proof of income and proof of bank balance to show you can afford the initial deposit.
        - The broker helps get a *pre-approval* (also called 'conditional approval') from a lender, which is a document confirming that the lender is willing to sell you a mortgage.
            - This doesn't commit you to the loan, but gives you certainty that you're able to take it if you want to.
4. **Offer**. There are mainly 2 ways to buy:
    - *Private treaty*: multiple anonymous offers are collected. The best one wins. 
        - Anonymity is legally protected.
        - These 'final' offers are still conditional (if negotiated) on the house passing building and pest inspection and formal approval from the bank.
    - *Auction*: multiple people compete and announce their offers. The best one wins.
        - A buyer's agent is recommended to keep you in check.
5. **Conveyancing advice** for signing the contract.
6. **Building and pest inspection**.
    - Pay for a report.
7. **Finalise loan** with the bank.
8. **Pre-settlement**:
    - You are entitled to a pre-settlement inspection to verify that the house is still in the same condition.
9. **Settlement**.
