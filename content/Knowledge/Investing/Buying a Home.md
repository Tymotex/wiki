## How to buy a house
1. Find the best home loan rate and get a **pre-approval**. This should be the first step you actually do in practice since a pre-approval confirms your price range.
    - A mortgage broker can help identify home loans. They're usually free for you to consult, however they earn a commission from the lenders.
        - You will need to provide proof of income and proof of bank balance to show you can afford the initial deposit.
        - The broker helps get a *pre-approval* (also called 'conditional approval') from a lender, which is a document confirming that the lender is willing to sell you a mortgage.
            - This doesn't commit you to the loan, but gives you certainty that you're able to take it if you want to.
2. **[[Knowledge/Investing/House Hunting|Find a house]]**. Expect the search to take months.
3. **Save money** for a deposit *and* other expected transaction costs.
    - â‰¥20% of a target property's value to avoid paying the lender's mortgage insurance (LMI).
    - Stamp duty at approximately 3-5.5% of the property's value. It needs to be paid within 30 days of settlement.
    - Conveyancing fees. 
4. **Offer**. There are mainly 2 ways to buy:
5. **Conveyancing advice** for signing the contract.
6. **Building inspection** and **pest inspection**.
    - Pay for a report from a reputable professional.
    - The timing of the inspections matters and can be a part of your conditional offer to buy the house in a private treaty. It can also help with negotiating down a price with the seller. For an auction, have these inspections done prior to the auction.
7. **Finalise loan** with the bank.
8. **Pre-settlement**:
    - You are entitled to a pre-settlement inspection to verify that the house is still in the same condition.
	 - Get insurance as soon as possible.
	 - Consider changing locks.
9. **Settlement**.
	 - Expect lazy cleaning by the previous owner-occupier. 
	 - The time prior to settlement allows for you to plan for getting the property tenanted as soon as possible. Get quotes for repairs during this time.
	 - Ensure utility service providers have switched fully to you.
