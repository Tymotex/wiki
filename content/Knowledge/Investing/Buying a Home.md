## How to buy a house
1. Save money.
    - 20% of a target property's value to avoid paying the lender's mortgage insurance (LMI).
    - Stamp duty.
    - Conveyancing fees. 
2. Find the best home loan rate.
    - A mortgage broker can help identify home loans. They're free for you to consult, however they earn a commission from the lenders.
    - Get a **pre-approval** from a lender. This doesn't commit you to the loan, but gives you certainty that you're able to take it.

### Stamp Duty

### Conveyancing
Conveyancing is a branch of law around the transfer of properties.
