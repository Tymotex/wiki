*Index funds* are a subclass of [[Knowledge/Investing/Mutual Funds|mutual funds]] that are [[Knowledge/Investing/Investing#Active vs Passive Investing|passively managed]] instead of [[Knowledge/Investing/Investing#Active vs Passive Investing|actively managed]]. They track a specific [[Knowledge/Investing/Market Index|market index]].

[[Knowledge/Investing/Index Funds|Index funds]], and *index investing* in general, were 'invented' by *Jack Bogle* in the 1970s, who founded [Vanguard](https://www.vanguard.com.au/). He essentially got sick of mutual funds charging people so much for active management. He's credited with being the person who has helped investors create more wealth than anyone else on the planet.

The expenses associated with *actively managed mutual funds* (those that have people monitoring investment performance) tend to be considerably higher than *passively managed mutual funds* (ie. index funds). Roughly, actively managed mutual funds often charge $1\text{-}2\%$ of your account balance per year while index funds charge well below $1\%$.

> *Investing in an index allows you to say "I don’t know anything about choosing a company, sector, country, or anything else, and I also don’t know how to choose a fund manager capable of choosing them. I accept that I don’t know. But I still need to invest for my future."* ([sourced from PassiveInvestingAustralia](https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/index-funds/))

It's widely recommended that most investors should just make monthly investments ([[Knowledge/Investing/Investing#Dollar-Cost Averaging DCA|dollar-cost averaging]]) into a low-cost [[Knowledge/Investing/Index Funds|index fund]].
> "Most investors, both institutional and individual, will find that the best way to own common stocks is through an index fund that charges minimal fees. Those following this path are sure to beat the net results (after fees and expenses) delivered by the great majority of investment professionals" — Warren Buffett, 1996 Letter to Shareholders.

Historically, the only time investing in index funds has *not* worked has been when people cave into their emotions and deviate from their commitment to invest a regular sum into an index fund and attempt to beat the market on their own. **Just stay the course**.

### Success of Index Investing
- Index funds have famously outperformed the vast majority of actively managed funds over the long term, after-fee.
- It not only offers reliably superior performance over longer time horizons, it also minimises the amount of time you spend on investing (since you don't have to research stocks) so you can spend time doing other meaningful things. For high earners, this time saved is non-trivial, and may have nullified any market outperformance you did achieve.
- Index investing is more easily done without emotion.

### What If We're At a Peak?
Jack Bogle recommends to always commit to investing in an index fund, even if they're priced at all-time highs and you're convinced that they're overvalued.
