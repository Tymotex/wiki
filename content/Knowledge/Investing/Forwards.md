title: Forwards
---

Forwards are [[Knowledge/Investing/Derivatives|derivatives]], or contracts, that are very similar to [[Knowledge/Investing/Futures|futures]], however they're traded *over-the-counter*, meaning there is less protection from defaults. The less stringent regulations around forwards means greater potential for returns and customised terms of the contract.
