title: Bid-Ask Spread
---

A bid is a *buy order* and an ask is a *sell order*. The *bid-ask spread* is the difference between a stock's bid price and ask price. Put differently, it represents the difference between the *highest price a buyer is willing to pay* and the *lowest price a seller is willing to sell*. If the bid price for a stock is $50 and the ask price is $52, then the bid-ask spread is $2.
- A lower spread and high number of shares on the bid and ask sides indicates a market with higher [[Knowledge/Economics/macroeconomics/Liquidity|liquidity]].
