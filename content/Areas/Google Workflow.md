## Workflow Checklist
- Use a tiled window manager such as i3.
    - Have the same shortcuts as the ones you use on your main PC.
- Set up the same Chrome extensions and keybindings as at home.
- Set up the same Obsidian setup (with permission, obviously).
    - Ideally: set up Quartz and host your knowledgebase. Wouldn't that be impressive?
    - Set up the kanban board.
    - Set up the daily notes and the template you'll use to log your accomplishments each day.


**Notes**:
- Collect kudos and achievements in Obsidian as well.
