title: Scuba Diving

Equipment:
- Scuba tank
- Buoyancy control device (BCD)
- Regulator and console

Tips:
- Avoid holding your breath. Breathe normally and continuously while the regular is on your mouth. **Blow a constant stream of bubbles when the regulator is not on your mouth**.
	- Holding your breath while ascending/descending can cause your lungs to expand/contract beyond what they normally should, causing a rupture.
- Equalise pressure in your ear's eustachian tube by pinching your nostrils and blowing against that gently. Do this regularly and early.
- Equalise pressure in your mask's air pocket by gently blowing out from your nose.
- Clear your mask by letting a bit of water inside, swishing it around, then letting it out by: tilting your head backwards and blowing through your nose, letting the water pour out from below.
- Clearing the regulator: 
- Keep your tongue pressed firmly on the roof of your mouth to take a 'cautious breath'.
- An object with positive buyoancy means it will tend to float. An object with neutral buoyancy will neither sink nor float. You tune your buoyancy by letting air in and out of your BCD.
	- You can check your buoyancy is correct by breathing in air (which means you'll lift up a bit) and then breathing out air
