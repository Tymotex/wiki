USB, *Universal Serial Bus*, is a connector protocol that's meant to provide a standard way for peripherals and host devices to talk to each other.

Below are the USB types to know about. They each may look different, have different data transfer speeds, may be used for charging, etc.:
- Type-A — it's basically deprecated by this point. Ignore.
- Type-B — it's basically deprecated by this point. Ignore.
- Mini USB — still in some use.
- Micro USB — still in some use.
- Type-C — currently most widespread, as of 2023.
- Thunderbolt 3 — found on high-end laptops and peripherals.
    - Thunderbolt 3 uses the USB-C connector standard and looks indistinguishable from Type-C connectors.
    - It has much higher data transfer speed than Type-C.
    - 
- Thunderbolt 4
    - For a port to be Thunderbolt 4 instead of Thunderbolt 3 means it must satisfy a stricter set of capabilities:
        - Must support two 4K displays, or one 8K display. Thunderbolt 3 is only required to support one 4K monitor, although some Thunderbolt 3s _could_ support two 4K or one 8K display.
        - For Thunderbolt 4 docks, you must be able to move your mouse or tap a key on your keyboard to wake up the system.
    - Just think of Thunderbolt 4 as an improvement over Thunderbolt 3. It is superior in every way except for price. Whatever you can use with Thunderbolt 3 you can use with Thunderbolt 4.
