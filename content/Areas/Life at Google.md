## First Few Days
[[Knowledge/Soft Skills/Excelling as a Graduate|Excelling as a new software engineering graduate]].

Some questions to ask:
- Based on your personal experience, do you have any advice on *when* to ask for help?
- What do you consider are the strongest signals that an L3 is ready to transition to an L4 engineer?
- How different do you feel now compared to when you first started out? (Maybe be more specific here)
- Do you have any advice to would give to yourself when you were just starting out your career in software engineering?
- Is there anything you're learning about recently?
- Do you have any thoughts on how to best absorb all the information in the first few weeks?
- What are the consequences of not meeting SLA for Storage services? I'm curious because they're not user-facing.
- How are the reliability targets determined for low-level services like for Storage? (it must be different to how they're determined for user-facing services like Gmail)
- How elaborate is the process of determining the reliability target and SLOs for a service? Do they change after being set?

## Ideas
- From the first days, begin writing ELI5 resources for Nooglers and people new to SRE.

## Workflow Checklist
- Use a tiled window manager such as i3.
    - Have the same shortcuts as the ones you use on your main PC.
- Set up the same Chrome extensions and keybindings as at home.
- Set up the same Obsidian setup (with permission, obviously).
    - Ideally: set up Quartz and host your knowledgebase. Wouldn't that be impressive?
    - Set up the kanban board.
    - Set up the daily notes and the template you'll use to log your accomplishments each day.

**Notes**:
- You **must** document your and achievements well. Do this in Obsidian as well. You'll need this for performance reviews and getting future roles. This might be the highest reward:effort ratio things you can do, and all these documented achievements will serve you for the entirety of your career.
    - Inspired from the channel 'A Life Engineered'. He suggest calling this a 'brag document' and adding new entries on-demand rather than on some daily/weekly basis.

## Things to do after work
- Take parents out to dinner.
- Walk along Darling Harbour bridge.
- Meet friends to chill.
- Study or read a book in a cafe.
- Attend some skills class in the city.
