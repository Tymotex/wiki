> "If you want people to learn and remember what you write, say it conversationally." I.e. *write the way you talk*. ([source](https://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/09/conversational_.html))

- Speak directly to the reader in a conversational manner, using 'I'/'We'/'You'.
    > "Your brain wakes up when its being talked *with* as opposed to talked *at*."
