### Coupling
Coupling describes how dependent one thing is on another. In object-oriented programming, it refers to how dependent one class is on another.

Although coupling is unavoidable in some instances, you should generally prioritise minimising coupling because it tends to improve the maintainability of your code. When changing a single part of a *highly coupled* system, you might find yourself changing many other parts of the system.

Another important point about low coupling is that it makes unit tests and integration tests easier to write *and* maintain.
