### Building a Second Brain
[[Areas/Reading/Building a Second Brain|Building a Second Brain]] by Tiago Forte. This book presents a set of low-level tactics that helped me streamline my management of knowledge, tasks and goals.
- You should make a digital personal knowledge management system that is production-focused where insights you capture and distil are readily discoverable and exploitable.
- Attention and time are your most valuable assets. A second brain prepares you to focus and execute, knowing all your research is done and can be leveraged at a whim.
- Start *producing* things in addition to consuming things.
