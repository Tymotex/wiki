Thinking that you can pick individual stocks and win. Yes, that's how Warren Buffett got rich, but the ability to do what he did is extraordinarily rare. Don't be full of yourself thinking you can pull the same thing off. The research shows that less than 1% of active funds outperform index funds over 30 years.

JL Collins doesn't like *dollar-cost averaging*. It's just delaying the risk according to him. 

Just put a substantial amount of your income into the market regularly. 

When the market drops, you should celebrate because you're getting more shares than otherwise. Selling should not be an option when your goal is to build wealth rather than *preserve* wealth.
