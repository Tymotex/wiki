## Introduction
Good morning <>. I'm Tim Zhang. I graduated from UNSW recently. I've interned at Google before, I was on the data acquisition SRE team. 

**My hobbies**: unfortunately I tend to spread my interest thinly across a number of hobbies.
- I like working on programming projects (specifically web dev and game dev)
- I like reading. I'm really upset that I never did much reading as a kid.
- I like powerlifting. I initially did it because my lifestyle really needed some balance, but I later enjoyed it quite a lot.

**Why SRE**: I was interested in SRE in particular because I really wanted to learn about problems that occur at large scale. 
From how it was described to me, I think time-pressure troubleshooting sounds scary and exciting and I think having that exposure early in my career would really help me learn a lot quickly.

I also read most of the Site Reliability Engineering book written by Google engineers and realised that this sort of work is incredibly important.

## Questions
**For colleagues**:
- What's your story? How did you end up at Google as a site reliability engineer?
- What made you pick SRE over any other role? I'm guessing that any SRE would've also been a great developer.
- What do you get up to in your free time?

**Technical**:
