title: Stoicism
---

Stoicism is a life philosophy concerned with how to flourish as human beings, rationally. Some core ideas are:
- **Dichotomy of control**: learn to separate events into those that you can control and those you can't.
- ***Amor fati*, the art of acquiescence** — truly accept the things you can't control. The main thing that's in your control is your attitude and response to the things out of your control.
- ***Memento mori*, remember death** — a reminder that your time is running out, and redirect your focus to the things that matter.
- **Virtues** — your only job is to be a *good man*. Embody temperance, compassion, courage and honesty. Doing so is what constitutes a meaningful life.

## Getting Started
Start with reading the work by the ancients:
- Meditations — Marcus Aurelius
- Letters of a Stoic — Seneca
- Discourses — Epictetus
   
## History
Stoicism's origin is credited to Zeno.
