## Workflow Checklist
- Use a tiled window manager such as i3.
    - Have the same shortcuts as the ones you use on your main PC.
- Set up the same Chrome extensions and keybindings as at home.
- Set up the same Obsidian setup (with permission, obviously).
    - Ideally: set up Quartz and host your knowledgebase. Wouldn't that be impressive?
    - Set up the kanban board.
    - Set up the daily notes and the template you'll use to log your accomplishments each day.

**Notes**:
- You **must** document your and achievements well. Do this in Obsidian as well. You'll need this for performance reviews and getting future roles. This might be the highest reward:effort ratio things you can do, and all these documented achievements will serve you for the entirety of your career.
    - Inspired from the channel 'A Life Engineered'. He suggest calling this a 'brag document' and adding new entries on-demand rather than on some daily/weekly basis.
