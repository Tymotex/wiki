Low interest rates and government incentives make real estate investment more attractive.

Property is usually less volatile and less risky.


Rental income can cover most or all of the mortgage, however you cannot rely on it because there may be times where your property is vacant.

*Positive gearing* is where you take a loan to invest, but the income from the investment exceeds your loan's repayments, ie. you're getting a positive net income despite the loan repayments. *Negative gearing* is when you take a loan to invest, but the income from that investment is still lower than the loan repayment. 
- For *positively geared investments*, you have to pay tax on your rental income. For *negatively geared investments*, you can claim a tax deduction on the loss.

Property expenses are tax deductible. This includes interest on your mortgage.

Real estate investment mostly does not require special domain knowledge.
