*Superannuation* is a government policy that forces your employer to skim ~10% (the [Super Guarantee rate](https://www.australiansuper.com/superannuation/superannuation-articles/2019/11/superannuation-guarantee-what-you-need-to-know)) off your salary and deposits it to your super fund. It was implemented by the Australian government to force individuals to save for retirement. It’s basically the Australian version of the US’ 401k. Generally, the superannuation contributions are subject to a much more lenient tax rate (~15%).

You can access the money in your superannuation account after you reach the ‘preservation age’, which is when you’re age 55-60, however this varies. There are no (legal) ways to access your super account, barring some exceptional circumstances (on compassionate grounds, home deposits, etc.).

### Super Funds
*Super funds* are financial institutions that manage your superannuation money and will invest it for you. Examples of super funds include UniSuper, SunSuper, Cbus Super, etc. 

Super funds usually give you a choice of different investment options that differ in risk/returns (‘growth’, ‘balanced’, ‘conservative’, ‘ethical’, etc.). By default, the ‘balanced’ investment option will be chosen for you which spreads your money out across shares and cash, typically 70% in shares or property and 30% in fixed interest. Some super funds may allow you more granular control over which asset classes your money is dumped into. UniSuper, for example, lets you dump however much you want into international shares, Australian shares, property, cash, etc.

#### Retail Super Funds & Industry Super Funds
There are *retail super funds* and *industry super funds*. They differ in what they do with profits.

**Retail super fund**: distributes profit to shareholders. These are usually associated with banks. Some retail super funds include Suncorp, ANZ Smart Choice Super, etc.

**Industry super fund**: are not-for profit, so profits are returned to members. These include super funds like AustralianSuper, UniSuper, SunSuper. They’re called industry funds because they used to mainly be associated with specific industries, but they’re mostly open to the public now.

> Historically (as of 2022, at least), industry super funds have outperformed retail super funds.

#### Picking a Super Fund
As advised by [moneysmart](https://moneysmart.gov.au/how-super-works/choosing-a-super-fund), search for the super fund's *'product disclosure statement'* and consider the following properties:
- Investment return performance (look at the last 5 years and beyond)
- Fees. They’re usually deducted from your balance each month and can either be a percentage or fixed amount.
- [[finance/personal-finance/Insurance|Insurance]]. Super funds usually give some insurance coverage to members by default. They include: life insurance, income protection and/or disability insurance. A premium will be deducted from your super for having this coverage.

Just use the government's [YourSuper comparison tool](https://www.ato.gov.au/YourSuper-Comparison-Tool/) to pick out a super. Alternatively, you can use non-government comparison tools like [Canstar](https://www.canstar.com.au/superannuation/), but remember that they're a business and may run promotions for certain institutions.

### Salary Sacrifice
An Australia-specific term for an arrangement between you and your employer where you trade a portion of your salary for some benefit from the employer, provided at no greater cost to them. Eg. [[Reading/Barefoot Investor|Barefoot Investor]] recommends arranging a salary sacrifice to increase the employer’s super contributions to 15%.
