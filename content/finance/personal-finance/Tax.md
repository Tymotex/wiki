Tax exists to provide income to the government which then uses the money to fund public healthcare, education, defence, infrastructure, and other public goods and services.



*Tax withholding* is the income tax that is taken out of your gross income by your employer that is routed to the ATO. This is part of the *pay-as-you-go* (PAYG) system implemented by the government to tax at the source.
