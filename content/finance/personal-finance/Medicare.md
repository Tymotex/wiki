Medicare is Australia's healthcare insurance scheme, backed by the government. All citizens and permanent residents get access to health services for free or very low costs (eg. visits to a general practitioner, medically necessary surgeries, prescription drugs, etc.).

Medicare is funded through the *Medicare levy* (2% of your taxable income) and *Medicare levy surcharge*. The levy is *in addition to* your regular income tax and is collected the same way. *Everyone must pay the levy* unless they meet [some exceptional criteria](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/medicare-and-tax).
