A tax return is a document that reports your income (from work, interest on bank accounts, investments, etc.) and expenses. You file tax returns annually in Australia, and doing so is called ‘lodging’ your tax return. It’s something you must do if you have had tax taken out of your pay over the tax year (spanning from July 1 to 30th of June).
- Your employer gives you an income statement that shows how much you earned and how much tax was deducted from your pay.
- You could pay a tax professional to help you do your tax return, or you can do it yourself with the help of tax software, like TaxSlayer.

### Tax Deductions
Tax deductions are work-related expenses that you can claim to reduce your tax. To claim something as work-related, you have to be able to prove that it’s helped you earn income. You must keep your purchase receipts around for 5 years after the claim (you can manage it in the ATO app's [myDeductions](https://ato.gov.au/mydeductions) tool).
