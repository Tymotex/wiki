A *security* is a tradable financial asset.

> It’s called a security “because there is a secure financial contract that is transferable, meaning it has clear, standardised, recognized terms, so can be bought and sold via the financial markets,” ([source](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/247926/how-did-security-semantically-shift-to-mean-tradable-financial-asset#:~:text=They%20are%20called%20securities%20because,sold%20via%20the%20financial%20markets.)).

Securities are divided into 3 categories mainly:
1. Debt securities like [[economics/macroeconomics/Bonds|bonds]].
2. Equities such as [[finance/investment/Stocks|stocks]].
3. Derivatives such as [[finance/investment/Futures|futures]], [[finance/investment/Options|options]], etc.
