Mutual funds are a managed investment service that collects together the money of many investors like you to purchase a specific set of [[finance/investment/Securities|securities]]. They're suited for people who want to participate in the stock market but minimise the time spent on buy/sell decisions about certain stocks.

When you buy a share of a mutual fund, you are getting a slice of the profits they get from their investment decisions. They're managed by financial professionals, although whether this is a [[finance/investment/Investing#Active vs Passive Investing|good thing or not]] is debatable.

Buying a share in a mutual fund is a good way to [[finance/investment/Portfolio#Diversification|diversify]] your investment portfolio since the mutual fund will often buy a wide range of assets.

There are many different kinds of mutual funds:
- *Equity mutual funds* invest in stocks.
- *Fixed-income mutual funds* invest in bonds.
- *Index mutual funds* invest in a whole [[finance/investment/Market Index|index]] like [S&P 500](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp).
- *Country mutual funds* invest only the securities in a single country.
- *Growth stock mutual funds* invest in [[finance/investment/Investing#Value vs Growth Investing|growth stocks]] instead of stocks in large established companies. Watch out for the *turnover ratio*.
