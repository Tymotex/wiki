*Index funds* are a subclass of [[finance/investment/Mutual Funds|mutual funds]] that are [[finance/investment/Investing#Active vs Passive Investing|passively managed]] instead of [[finance/investment/Investing#Active vs Passive Investing|actively managed]]. They track a specific [[finance/investment/Market Index|market index]].

[[finance/investment/Index Funds|Index funds]], and *index investing* in general, were 'invented' by a guy named *Jack Bogle* in the 1970s, who founded [Vanguard](https://www.vanguard.com.au/). He essentially got sick of mutual funds charging people so much for active management. He's credited with being the person who has helped investors create more wealth than anyone else on the planet.

The expenses associated with *actively managed mutual funds* (those that have people monitoring investment performance) tend to be considerably higher than *passively managed mutual funds* (ie. index funds). Roughly, actively managed mutual funds often charge $1\text{-}2\%$ of your account balance per year while index funds charge well below $1\%$.
