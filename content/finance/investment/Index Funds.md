Index funds are a subclass of [[finance/investment/Mutual Funds|mutual funds]] that are [[finance/investment/Investing#Active vs Passive Investing|passively managed]] instead of [[finance/investment/Investing#Active vs Passive Investing|actively managed]].
They track a specific [[finance/investment/Market Index|index]].

[[finance/investment/Index Funds|Index funds]], and *index investing* in general, were 'invented' by a guy named *Jack Bogle* in the 1970s. He essentially got sick of mutual funds charging people so much for active management.

The expenses associated with *actively managed mutual funds* (those that have people monitoring investment performance) tend to be considerably higher than *passively managed mutual funds* (ie. index funds). Roughly, actively managed mutual funds often charge $1\text{-}2\%$ of your account balance per year while index funds charge well below $1\%$.
