An *investment* is the purchase of an asset or commodity with the expectation of it producing income for you or appreciating in value. *Investing* is the set of theory and practices around making smart investments that aid you in meeting your financial goals.

1. Understand the power of compounding. Start early and invest regularly.
2. Understand [[finance/investment/Portfolio#Diversification|diversification]].
3. Only invest in what you understand. 
4. Would you want to be an owner of that business? 

> The main difference between a *trader* and an *investor* is how long they hold the asset. Traders focus on capitalising on short-term trends.

## Investing in the Stock Market
### Active vs. Passive Investing
*Active* management involves monitoring the performance of an investment portfolio and making decisions about whether to buy, sell or hold and asset. It aims to 'beat the market' by adopting certain investing strategies and does not support the [[finance/investment/Efficient Market Hypothesis|efficient market hypothesis]] which implies it's not possible to 'beat the market' over the long run.

*Passive* management, known as 'index investing', is about mirroring a [[finance/investment/Market Index|market index]] and is usually associated with [[finance/investment/Index Funds|index funds]] and [[finance/investment/Exchange Traded Funds|ETFs]]. 

Whether active or passive investment outperforms the other in the long term is an ongoing debate.

### Value vs. Growth Investing
*Value investing* is about being able to see the intrinsic value of something, then buying that thing when its priced lower than the intrinsic value. *Value investors* believe the stock market to overreact to good or bad news and set prices that aren't reflective of the true value of a stock, which gives rise to an opportunity to profit.

Put simply, if you know the *true* value of jewelry, and you find some overlooked cheap jewelry in a garage sale, then you would obviously exploit the opportunity.

*Growth investing*, on the other hand, is about investing in the stock of smaller companies whose earnings are expected to climb at a much higher rate than established companies.

### Investing Strategies

> Random youtube comment: For beginners, i would go 95-97% funds / etfs and 3%-5% a stock you like. Gets you into the habit of researching stocks and looking at daily life and what companies impact you.
