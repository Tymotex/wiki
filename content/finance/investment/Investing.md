## Investing in the Stock Market
### Active vs. Passive Investing
*Active* management involves monitoring the performance of an investment portfolio and making decisions about whether to buy, sell or hold and asset. It aims to 'beat the market' by adopting certain investing strategies. *Passive* management, known as 'index investing', is about mirroring a [[finance/investment/Market Index|market index]]. Passive investment is associated with [[finance/investment/Mutual Funds|mutual funds]] and [[finance/investment/Exchange Traded Funds|ETFs]]. 

Whether active or passive investment outperforms the other in the long term is an ongoing debate.

### Value vs. Growth Investing
*Value investing* is about being able to see the intrinsic value of something, then buying that thing when its priced lower than the intrinsic value. *Value investors* believe the stock market to overreact to good or bad news and set prices that aren't reflective of the true value of a stock, which gives rise to an opportunity to profit.

Put simply, if you know the *true* value of jewelry, and you find some overlooked cheap jewelry in a garage sale, then you would obviously exploit the opportunity.

*Growth investing*, on the other hand, is about investing in the stock of smaller companies whose earnings are expected to climb at a much higher rate than established companies.

### Investing Strategies

> Random youtube comment: For beginners, i would go 95-97% funds / etfs and 3%-5% a stock you like. Gets you into the habit of researching stocks and looking at daily life and what companies impact you.
