Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a subclass of [[finance/investment/Mutual Funds|mutual funds]] that are very similar to [[finance/investment/Index Funds|index funds]], with the main difference being that you can buy/sell shares whenever the stock market is open as opposed to only once a day. ETFs and index funds are sometimes used interchangeably incorrectly.

An ETF *is* a [[finance/investment/Securities|security]], so it is tradeable and has a share price that rises/falls.

### ETFs vs Index Funds
Pick index funds over ETFs if you want to remove the temptation of impulse buying/selling stocks and let you automatically reinvest earnings back into your account.
