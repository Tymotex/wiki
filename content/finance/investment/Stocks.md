*Stocks* represent pieces of official ownership, called 'ownership equity', of a business. 

Stocks are traded in the [[finance/investment/Stock Market|stock market]].

Stocks are [[finance/investment/Securities|securities]].


*Shares* are the smallest denomination of company stock.

Owning shares in a company makes you a *shareholder* of that company. Shareholders get to vote and sometimes get a portion of the business' profits, called [[finance/investment/Stocks#Dividends|dividends]]. If the company *becomes more profitable* between the time you bought the shares and the time you sell it, you'll have [[finance/investment/Investing#Capital Gains|capital gains]] on the shares.

Your ownership is quantifiable as: $\frac{\text{Company X stocks that you have}}{\text{Total Company X stocks}} \times 100\%$.

Companies will usually have millions or billions of total shares, called 'outstanding shares'.

Your ownership gives you voting power in meetings and elections within the company. Generally, 1 share held gives you 1 vote, however this is set by the company, who can also split off shares into different classes where one class' shares have a greater weighting than another in terms of voting power.


### FAQ
Some questions I grappled with in trying to understand stocks.

#### What is the intrinsic value of a stock?

#### Why do people seem to reliably generate wealth in the stock market?
Although it's seen and believed that many people lose a lot of money through trading in the stock market and that it's a risky endeavour, most investors still highly recommend you to participate in the stock market.

TODO.

#### What's the difference between stocks, shares and equities?
In everyday conversation, all 3 are the same. Formally, however, there are differences:
- *Stock*: a representation of ownership in a company.
- *Share*: the smallest denomination of company stock.
- *Equity*: generally, it's the ownership of assets that have liabilities associated with them. For example, a *home equity* is the difference between the market value and the remaining balanced owed on a mortage.

The *stock market*, *share market* and *equity market* all refer to the same thing.

#### Why are stocks called 'stocks'?
In medieval Europe, people recorded debts by etching marks on tally sticks and splitting them. When split, the stick would have a very unique pattern of splitting that was hard to tamper with. The longer part was called the 'stock', given to the lender, the shorter part was called the 'foil', given to the borrower. These sticks were considered legal proofs of transactions for hundreds of years until the 1800s.

#### Why do companies sell stocks?
When companies choose to list themselves on a *stock exchange* like the Nasdaq, they're provided with [[economics/macroeconomics/Liquidity|liquidity]] and a means to acquire money for capital investment. The tradeoff is that they're subject to greater expenses and tighter regulation.

To grow your company into an *empire* requires you to have access to a huge amount of capital, ie. money to invest in your ventures and operations. When a company can attract investors by listing themselves on the stock market, they'll be able to lease an office, hire more people, get more equipment, pursue more marketing efforts, etc.

An alternative way for companies to raise capital is to sell [[economics/macroeconomics/Bonds|bonds]]. Many companies will opt to sell both stocks and bonds. The act of selling shares is called *equity financing* and the act of selling bonds is called *debt financing*. For most startups, they simply don't have the assets to really sustainably meet debt payments, so equity financing is the preferred route, where they don't have to pay as much as they grow.

Companies can also acquire funding from [[finance/investment/Venture Capital|venture capital]] firms or [[finance/investment/Angel Investors|angel investors]].

### Dividends
A dividend is a payment distributed by the company to shareholders, usually every 3 months. Many companies won't pay dividends and will reinvest it back into the company.

There are *dividend reinvestment plans* which automatically use the cash payment you'd usually get to buy more of the company's stock.

### Common Shares vs. Preferred Shares
Shares are usually either *common shares* and *preferred shares*. Preferred shareholders get priority over common shareholders when receiving dividends and the assets if the company [[finance/investment/Stocks#Liquidation|liquidates]].

### Liquidation
Liquidation is when a business dies. When liquidated, a business' assets are distributed to shareholders proportionally based on how many shares each of them own.

Businesses die when they become *insolvent*, which means that their liquid assets 

### IPO (Initial Public Offering)
An *initial public offering* (IPO) is when a private company sells shares to the general public for the first time.

To IPO, a company must clear certain requirements by the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/).
