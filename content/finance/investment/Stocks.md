*Stocks* represent pieces of official ownership, called 'ownership equity', of a business. 

Stocks are traded in the [[finance/investment/Stock Market|stock market]].

Stocks are [[finance/investment/Securities|securities]].


*Shares* are the smallest denomination of company stock.

Owning shares in a company makes you a *shareholder* of that company. Shareholders get to vote and sometimes get a portion of the business' profits, called [[finance/investment/Stocks#Dividends|dividends]]. If the company *becomes more profitable* between the time you bought the shares and the time you sell it, you'll have [[finance/investment/Investing#Capital Gains|capital gains]] on the shares.

Your ownership is quantifiable as: $\frac{\text{Company X stocks that you have}}{\text{Total Company X stocks}} \times 100\%$.

Companies will usually have millions or billions of total shares, called 'outstanding shares'.

### FAQ
Some questions I grappled with in trying to understand stocks.

#### What is the intrinsic value of a stock?

#### Why do people seem to reliably generate wealth in the stock market?
Although it's seen and believed that many people lose a lot of money through trading in the stock market and that it's a risky endeavour, most investors still highly recommend you to participate in the stock market.

#### What's the difference between stocks, shares and equities?
In everyday conversation, all 3 are the same. Formally, however, there are differences:
- *Stock*: a representation of ownership in a company.
- *Share*: the smallest denomination of company stock.
- *Equity*: generally, it's the ownership of assets that have liabilities associated with them. For example, a *home equity* is the difference between the market value and the remaining balanced owed on a mortage.

The *stock market*, *share market* and *equity market* all refer to the same thing.

#### Why are stocks called 'stocks'?
In medieval Europe, people recorded debts by etching marks on tally sticks and splitting them. When split, the stick would have a very unique pattern of splitting that was hard to tamper with. The longer part was called the 'stock', given to the lender, the shorter part was called the 'foil', given to the borrower. These sticks were considered legal proofs of transactions for hundreds of years until the 1800s.

### Dividends
A dividend is a payment distributed by the company to shareholders, usually every 3 months. Many companies won't pay dividends and will reinvest it back into the company.

There are *dividend reinvestment plans* which automatically use the cash payment you'd usually get to buy more of the company's stock.

### Common Shares vs. Preferred Shares
