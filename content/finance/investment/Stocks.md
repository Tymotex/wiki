Stocks represent pieces of official ownership of a business.


### Dividends
A dividend is a payment distributed by the company to shareholders, usually every 3 months.

There are *dividend reinvestment plans* which automatically use the cash payment you'd usually get to buy more of the company's stock.

Many companies won't pay dividends and reinvest it back into the company.
