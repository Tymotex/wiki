> The stock market is the greatest opportunity machine ever created.

The *stock market*, also called the *share market*, is the buy/sell [[economics/microeconomics/Market|market]] for [[finance/investment/Stocks|stocks]]. Even though it’s called ‘stock market’, you can also trade other securities like [[finance/investment/Exchange Traded Funds|ETFs]], corporate [[economics/macroeconomics/Bonds|bonds]], [[finance/investment/Derivatives|derivatives]] based on stocks, commodities, currencies and bonds in the stock market. To buy stocks, you need a broker.

A *stock exchange* is a centralised place that has the infrastructure to facilitate the trading of stocks. NASDAQ, NYSE and ASX are examples of *stock exchanges*.

### Understanding the Stock Market
The basis of the stock market existence is the incentive for companies to acquire funding to execute their ideas and the incentive for individuals with money (called investors) to invest and benefit from the success of those companies.

As a company becomes more profitable, its stocks increase in value (demand). The reverse also happens.

The profitability of a company can fluctuate massively — due to material shortages, leadership changes, bad publicity, new regulations, etc.
