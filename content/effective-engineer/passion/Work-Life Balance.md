title: Work-Life Balance
description: Work-Life Balance

This is a heavily opinionated topic. People have deeply conflicting beliefs of how concretely one should segregate 'work' and 'life'.

Some probably controversial opinions I hold, sourced from people I look up to:
- Work/life balance shouldn't exist. You just have the wrong mindset if you're worrying about it.
	> "To achieve true work/life balance, at least how I see it, is to not achieve it at all, but to blue the lines so well that everything becomes 'life'" â€” John Sonmez.
- Give your company your 40 hours per week, then give however much you can beyond that to working for yourself. Spend the time you would otherwise spend overworking by working on other things in your life that make you more valuable, like your own software projects, online courses, reading, a side business, etc.
- You have the capacity to enjoy literally every second of your life, provided you are *present*.
