### Lead By Example
Good leaders *always lead by example* and do themselves what they ask from their team. They will always hold themselves to a higher level of accountability before the team.

This implies that you must always be willing to get into the front lines, just like in the battlefield as a general. If you want your team to adopt Agile methodologies, you must demonstrate that you're actively using it first. If you want your team to have a strong work ethic, you must demonstrate that yourself. 

### Responsibility
Being a good leader means to assume $100\%$ responsible for **every** single failure you encounter in your team's endeavours, and ultimately in your personal life and relationships. You are always to blame. *No exceptions*.
> There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.

When your team members screw up or even actively sabotage things, it is still your fault. You could have trained them better, confirmed that they were in agreeance with plans, etc. Likewise, when the team is successful, you must ensure the credit is distributed to the team's members, *not to yourself*.

### Subordinate Leadership (Delegation)
Train and trust your members.
