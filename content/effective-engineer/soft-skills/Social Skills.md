Soft skills encompass communication skills, teamwork skills, work ethic and just having a growth mindset and seeing your interactions with others as a non-zero sum game.

### First Impressions
They can't be reversed. Humility is always an excellent quality, however aim to represent yourself with an authentic level of confidence *and* curiosity. 
- Err on the side of overdressing for the first few days and adjust to the culture.

### Generosity
Always show your willingness to help your peers, even to the extent of putting them before yourself. Competition is helpful, but in your personal interactions of others, always demonstrate authentic selflessness and a desire to see the other person succeed. Stop treating your career as a zero-sum game.

### Conflict
Do not avoid it when it arises. It's *always* mutually beneficial to resolve it.
