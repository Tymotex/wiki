### First Impressions
They can't be reversed. Humility is always an excellent quality, however aim to represent yourself with an authentic level of confidence *and* curiosity. 

### Dress Code
*The way that you dress matters*, even when the dress code is non-existent where you work (as they often are for tech companies). People will always judge you based on your appearance, no exceptions, and that's a fact of life. See the ['Halo Effect'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect).

Furthermore, dressing in professional clothes reinforces your identity as a professional to yourself and others, and you will tend to conduct yourself in a way that is congruent with this identity.

### Contradictions
Personality/appearance contrasts are polarising and inexplicably magnetic.
