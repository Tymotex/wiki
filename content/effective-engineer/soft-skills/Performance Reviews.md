### Schedule Regular Reviews
You must have regular one-on-one discussion with your manager/boss about your performance. Ideally weekly or fortnightly at a minimum.

Directly ask how you are doing and what can be improved. [[effective-engineer/soft-skills/Performance Reviews#Document Everything|Document]] their response.

Make your goals known to your manager/boss. For instance, if you're trying to get promoted from an L3 engineer to an L4 engineer, make that obvious every conversation.

### Document Everything
*Document everything*. 
1. Create daily logs and weekly reports of your high-level progress.
2. Manage a growing knowledgebase.
3. Note the books you've read and other educational pursuits that show improvement.
4. Save all the emails where you have received praise for you work.

Put up a fight if you haven't been promoted when you expected to be. If you document *everything*, you'll have a mountain of evidence to support your case that cannot be ignored.
