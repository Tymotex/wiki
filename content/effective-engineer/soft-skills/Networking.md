### Networking Misconceptions
Networking, the act of deliberately developing professional contacts, must be done with the intent of giving as many people what they want as possible. Approaching it with a self-serving mindset is incorrect. For this reason, it is best done when you're *not actively looking for things from people*, ie. a job. When you make networking about providing value to others, it stops being something you dread doing. It's a long-term investment and is meant to be built over years and to deliver value over years, not days.

Networking is to be done everywhere, not just at your university on-campus networking fair. You should seek opportunities all the time to deliver value to the new people you come across.
