> "The human brain's capacity doesn't change from one year to the next, so the insights from studying human behaviour have a very long shelf life. What was difficult for users twenty years ago continues to be difficult today." — Jakob Nielsen

> In the last few years, making things more usable has become almost everybody's responsibility. Visual designers and developers now often find themselves doing things like interaction design (deciding what happens next when the user clicks, taps, or swipes) and information architecture (figuring out how everything should be organised).

I've personally found this to be very true. Thinking about how to arrange user interactions and where to put UI components wherever it makes sense tends to be a huge frictional point during development.

Usability is defined to be a function of the following parameters:
- Useful — does it fulfil an important requirement?
- Learnable — do you have to think to know how to use it?
- Desirable — is it pleasing?

In English, usability is whether:
> A person of average ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it's worth.

## Law #1 — Don't Make Me Think
Design decisions exist on a spectrum from *obvious* to *requiring thought*. Always prefer designs on the *obvious* side (a useful rule when disputing design conflicts with someone else).

- Always make clickable things *obviously clickable*.



People skim pages for something clickable, most of the time.
