title: Building a Second Brain
---

> We consume more books, podcasts, articles, and videos than we could possibly absorb. What do we really have to show for all the knowledge we've gained? How many of the great ideas we've had or encountered have faded from our minds before we even had a chance to put them into practice?

> A report from he International Data Corporation found that **26 percent** of a typical knowledge worker's day is spent looking for and consolidating information spread across a variety of systems.

> Think of [your second brain] as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas.

Your second brain is a lifelong repository of your knowledge and growth.

> In its most practical form, creativity is about connecting ideas together, especially ideas that don't seem to be connected.

> Innovation and impact don't happen by accident or chance. Creativity depends on a *creative process*.

About writer's block:
> "It's not that I'm blocks. It's that I don't have enough research to write with opwer and knowledge about the topic. It always mens, not that I can't find the right words, [but rather] that I don't have the ammunition." — Sebastian Junger, author and filmmaker

On the encountering of new information:
1. C, *capture* — keep what resonates. Be judicious and select the most noteworthy ideas you encounter. They should evoke curiosity or some kind of a-ha moment.
	> Adopting the habit of knowledge capture has immediate benefits for our mental health and peace of mind. We can let go of the fear that our memory will fail us at a crucial moment. Instead of jumping at every new headline and notification, we can choose to consume information that adds value to our lives and consciously let go of the rest.
2. O, *organise* — save for actionability.
	> The best way to organise your notes is to *organise for action*, according to the active projects you are working on right now.
3. D, *distil* — find the essence and write the main takeaways. You should think: "how can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?" 
	> Every idea has an "essence": the heart and soul of what it is trying to communicate.
4. E, *express* — show your work.
	> A common challenge for people who are curious and love to learn is that we can fall into the habit of continuously force-feeding ourselves more and more information, but never actually take the next step and apply it.
	
	For instance, at this moment I've read books on entrepreneurship and dating, neither of which I have made steps to doing (because I keep rationalising about myself being lacking in knowledge and time).

	> **Shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming to creating**.
