- Need to make the private content exist in a private repository.
- Automate the initialisation of a new project with a Python/Rust/Go script.
	- Use Tiago's preflight checklist:
		- Reminder: projects should always have an MVP definition, starting time and deadline. They're a big investment of time and energy and should be clearly aligned with your values.
		- What do you want to learn?
		- What challenges can you foresee?
		- What (further) research needs to be done?
		- What is the MVP? (For non-output based products, what is the success criteria?)
		- What are the stretch goals?
	- Use Tiago's postmortem checklist:
		- What did you learn?
		- What did you do well?
		- What could you have done better?
