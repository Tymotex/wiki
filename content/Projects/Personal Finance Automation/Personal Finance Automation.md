## Next Steps
- [x] Find a good spreadsheet template and build your own. Use it for a while.
- Spreadsheet tasks
    - [ ] Add data validation dropdowns.
    - [ ] Highlight spending transactions as red and income transactions as green.
- [ ] What is a trust?

## Questions
- [x] Should I track on a spreadsheet or app?
    Spreadsheets vs. apps:
    - Spreadsheets are extremely customisable.
    - Spreadsheets are more manually-driven. 
        - There is a good psychological reason for manually 
        - Decoupling yourself from the tracking of expenses makes you less likely to be mindful about your spending.
- [x] Screen scraping vs using an API?
    - Do it when there's no API available.
- [x] Can I pull bank account and transactions CSV data from ING? Can I do it every 24 hours or at least on system startup or something?
    - Doesn't seem possible with their APIs üôÅ. Screen-scraping is an option but I'd have to get past the keypad auth.
- [x] Can I scrape the account balance from UniSuper?
    - Doubt it, but I can screen-scrape.
- [ ] Set this system up for your parents as well. Ideally, they should be able to look at it and understand.

**Note**: first, I should try manually tracking personal finances and then seek to automate the pain points.

## Goals
I want to feel in control of my finances. This might be among the greatest sources of stress in my life if left uncontrolled.

I want to be extremely aggressive with saving. I want almost all of my spending to be allocated towards things that appreciate (investments) or things that help me become more productive or genuinely happier (capital).

## Requirements
- Automatic categorisation.
- Data visualisation by category for my spending.
- Daily/weekly/monthly summaries of how much I've spent.
- Visualise the total balance in all my bank accounts.
- How my net worth changes over time.
- Show investments value.
- Superannuation monitoring.
