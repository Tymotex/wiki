title: Personal Finance Automation
---
## Next Steps
- [ ] Find a good spreadsheet template and build your own. Use it for a while.

## Questions
- [x] Should I track on a spreadsheet or app?
    Spreadsheets vs. apps:
    - Spreadsheets are extremely customisable.
    - Spreadsheets are more manually-driven. 
        - There is a good psychological reason for manually 
        - Decoupling yourself from the tracking of expenses makes you less likely to be mindful about your spending.
- [x] Screen scraping vs using an API?
    - Do it when there's no API available.
- [ ] Can I pull bank account and transactions CSV data from ING? Can I do it every 24 hours or at least on system startup or something?
- [ ] Can I scrape the account balance from UniSuper?

**Note**: first, I should try manually tracking personal finances and then seek to automate the pain points.
