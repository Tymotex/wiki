## Questions
- Should I track on a spreadsheet or a dashboard?

## Requirements
- Automatic categorisation.
- Data visualisation for categories for my spending.
- Daily/weekly/monthly summaries of how much I've spent.
- Visualise the total in all my bank accounts.
- How my net worth changes over time.
- Shows investments value.
- Superannuation monitoring.

## Ideas
