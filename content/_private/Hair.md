TODO:
- Shampoo materials?
- Conditioner materials?

**About my hair**:
- Straight. 
    - This means it tends to be oilier because it's easier for oil to travel along the hair shaft.
- Medium hair porosity (I think)
- Fine hair texture
- Medium hair density (I think)
- Oily hair
    - Overwashing may stimulate more sebum production. Prefer washing less frequently.

## Shampoo
Shampooing too often can strip hair of its natural oils and dry out scalp. The recommended frequency is once a week.

## Conditioner
Unlike shampoo, it's recommended to use conditioner often.

Water-based

Oil-based

Leave-in conditioner.

Rinse-out conditioner.

## Scalp Exfoliation
You need to get rid of dirt buildup and dead skin cells.

## Styling
- **Gel** provides the strongest hold but greatest shine. Prefer gentler gels.
    - Apply before blow-drying for a softer look.
- **Wax** provides medium hold with medium shine. 
- **Cream** provides low hold and low shine. Prefer this for longer hairstyles.
    - Apply on dry hair.
    - Blow-dry for stronger hold.
- **Pomade** provides medium hold and high shine. Prefer this for combed styles.
- **Paste**.
    - Prefer clay. It provides stronger hold and low shine, and is good for your hair health.

## Korean Perm
Traditional perms produce stiff, tight curls. Korean perms produce long natural waves that add volume.
- It's low maintenance and lasts longer.

*Digital perm* is a perm technique, often used to create a Korean perm with bigger and more natural-looking waves and it should last longer. Cold perms and other methods are also used.

Steps:
1. Hair trim.
2. Chemical applied to hair that breaks down the structure of your hair.
3. Hair wrapped around several rollers. **Prefer larger rollers** for long and loose waves.
4. Heat is applied to the hair.
5. Another chemical is applied which structurally creates curls in your hair.
6. Rollers are undone, then your hair is washed.
7. Final trims.
