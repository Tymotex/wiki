## Korean Perm
Traditional perms produce stiff, tight curls. Korean perms produce long natural waves that add volume.
- It's low maintenance and lasts longer.

*Digital perm* is a perm technique, often used to create a Korean perm with bigger and more natural-looking waves and it should last longer. Cold perms and other methods are also used.

Steps:
1. Hair trim.
2. Chemical applied to hair that breaks down the structure of your hair.
3. Hair wrapped around several rollers. **Prefer larger rollers** for long and loose waves.
4. Heat is applied to the hair.
5. Another chemical is applied which structurally creates curls in your hair.
6. Rollers are undone, then your hair is washed.
7. Final trims.
