## Things triggering PMO
- Lying in bed for too long.
    - **Alteration**: always get up to turn off your alarm. It's unlikely you'll crawl back to bed. For naps
- Suddenly seeing a girl's profile picture on Messenger... Yup.
- Suddenly seeing a sexually attractive girl in an ad or elsewhere digitally.
- Being unfocused and not engaged in the task at hand.
- Being frustrated with the task at hand.
- Having a sexual dream that my mind keeps returning to throughout the day.
- Thinking about girls who have liked me in the past. This is probably the most triggering thought.

## The solution
When you're horny beyond reason:
- Drop down and do push-ups.
- Go walk outside in your backyard, or the park.
- Go find and talk to mum.
- Go eat food.
- Read the warning below.

Expect to have an emergency a few times a month.

## Read this when you're wavering
Remember the reasons why you're refusing to be a wanker.
- **You feel so fucking ashamed for masturbating**.
    - Masturbating is a form of *self-castration*.
        - You feel less competitive. You are letting your rivals overtake you. You are letting those people who want to see you fail win. You are letting other men fuck the woman that you want.
        - You feel less desire towards women. 
        - You feel less physically vigorous. You won't be able to bring your best self forward into your powerlifting sessions.
        - You become a docile, weak, husk of a man.
    - It won't help you focus. It'll leave you unfocused *and* ashamed about what you did, worsening your capacity to work.
    - There is nothing more emasculating than 
- **Your social skills and willingness to be around others plummets**.
    - PMO is not part of your identity. When you do it, the incongruence between your identity and your actions causes you to feel deeply dishonest in your interactions with others, as if you have some disgusting secret to hide (which you do if you masturbate and watch porn).
- **You become less stoic, iron-willed and disciplined**.
    - You are a person who is resilient to the chaos of life and volatility of the internal mind. When you PMO however, it's evidence that your will is breakable and suddenly everything you value begins to collapse around you. 
- **The instant gratification is so fucking devastating, mentally**.
    - You completely fuck your reward circuitry.
        - Everything else feels less meaningful to do.
        - Your liveliness in pursuing goals diminishes.
    - Nothing meaningful in life comes easily.
- **You're doing this for other people**.
    - Think of how mum would feel, knowing that you're doing this disgusting, pathetic act in secret. Think of the role you play in making her live a long and happy life. It is directly dependent on her being able to witness you blossom into a man of real character and integrity. To masturbate is essentially to make a statement that your mum's well-being is not important to you. What kind of fucking reprehensible, wretched lowlife are you to pick a few seconds of braindead pleasure over your mum.
    - Think of how your future girlfriend would feel. Think of how lucky she would be to be with a man who has conquered a thing that very few men manage to conquer. Think about the amazing pleasure you'd give to your life's companion and how much more joyous your life together would be by not being a degenerate.
    - Think about how your future children will feel. Think of how lucky they'd feel knowing they have a true father figure.
    - Think of your mentors/idols. These people all need you to be strong and remain true to your character.
        - Lex Fridman.
        - Jocko Willink.
        - Chris Williamson.
        - Jordan Peterson.
        - David Goggins.
- **Above all, masturbating is fundamental betrayal of your character**.
    - *Masturbation is a form of giving up*. It's a form of giving up because you are unwilling to have the patience to build yourself up to be an attractive man. **You are not the kind of person that fucking gives up**.

### If you can't focus
- It's probably because you're **tired** or **frustrated**. Go nap or take a break.

### If you're rationalising
- Stop lying to yourself that masturbation will help you focus, or that you deserve it after hard work.
- Think of the hundreds of times you have followed the same line of thinking and felt fucking miserable for following through. **There are absolutely 0 good reasons** to masturbate. No exceptions.
- You often think that life should be experienced to the fullest, meaning you should experience the pleasure of masturbation and having orgasms. **Do the opposite** to experience life to the fullest. You will only feel like an empty husk and everything else feels significantly less enjoyable. You will hate life if you masturbate and when the pleasure arrives, you realise that it was just a siren's call.
- There are plenty of critiques against being anti-porn. It doesn't matter what people say. You know subjectively how much of a fucking loser it makes you feel like.

## Relapses
### 15th Sep: 
I just woke up groggy and being obsessive over the idea of translucent panties... Yup. I dragged myself up to go do bench press but the whole time I could not stop thinking about it. I finally caved in after around 1 full hour of ridiculous horny energy and made a promise with myself that I could pick exactly one picture and use that to satisfy my needs. This means no real porn, but allowing for masturbation and orgasm. I don't know how reasonable this is since I made this promise while horny as hell.

Even after caving in, I still felt hopelessly horny. After getting into my day however, I felt completely free of horny thoughts and could focus on my work.

I'll consider all relapses to be when I masturbate and orgasm to anything other than that one picture I have. I'll do this for 1 month.
