## Heroes
These are the people I aspire to be like. The attribute I venerate in each of these people is their mental toughness and temperance.

### Marcus Aurelius

> "Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one." — Marcus Aurelius.

His first act as emperor was to transfer a significant part of his power to Lucius Verus, his adoptive brother.

Some tragedies during his reign:
- Floods.
- Invasion by the Parthian Empire.
- Antonine plague.
- Germanic tribes invading from the north.
- Betrayal by close companion Avidius Cassius.

### David Goggins

Goggins proves to me that it's possible to push yourself through what seems like insurmountable pain. Knowing that a person like him exists has made think about how much of a little bitch I really am. I've become aware and disgusted towards my weaker self because of him, and it has helped me to bring out a superior man out of me.

### Elon Musk

He's controversial, impulsive, eccentric and has man flaws as a person, but I think he has a level of intelligence and tenacity that is undeniable. I admire that he is a person that will sleep on the factory floor, work several times harder than several people combined, and wear down his own sanity and health just to get something done. He's an engineer and he's obsessed with things. I've picked him as a personal hero because I want to emulate a similar kind of devotion to a greater cause, learning deeply about everything, and working hard until your mind and body break down before you.

### Lex Fridman

Lex is a person, I discovered, whose attitude towards work, life and love resonates strongest with me. Out of all the people I know, I think this person is most like the person I see myself becoming:
1. An engineer and scientist.
2. Curious and extremely open to new ideas, however absurd and in conflict with his own ideas. He talks to a wide spectrum of people, almost all of which I also deeply revere and resonate with.
3. Holds himself to a extremely high standards. Ruthlessly humble.
4. Plays guitar, is a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, likes RPG and story-driven video games.
5. Holds the idea of love as central to the meaning of his existence.

### Jocko Willink

Jocko clearly fits into the archetype of a stoic hypermasculine soldier, but what I admire is his humility, open-mindedness and unwavering discipline. Contrary to his 'meathead' appearance and demeanour, he is intelligent, well-read and has a degree of emotional awareness rarely seen in people. 

This is a man that always shows up early and always takes ownership. If he's told you will do A, he will do A, uncompromisingly.

### Theodore Roosevelt

This guy is a shining example in all the areas of life I care about: work, learning, integrity, discipline. Even during his presidency, he exercises intensely daily and for several hours. He wrote somewhere around 40 books. He basically 100%-ed life.

He got shot on-stage for a speech one time, survived by sheer chance, and still spoke for 84 minutes afterwards. That kind of equanimity and stubbornly stoic character is one I deeply admire and hope to emulate in my life.

## Other Heroes
- Sam Harris — for his eloquence, intelligence and calmness.
- Joe Rogan — for his open-mindedness and celebration of other people.
- Bjarne Stroustrup — for his devotion to computer science and skill in programming.
- Jordan Peterson — for his eloquence, integrity and guidance during testing times.
- Felix Kjellberg — for his growth as a person. I watched him purely for entertainment when I was young. Revisiting him several years later, I have witnessed him making mistakes and taking responsibility for them, acknowledging the importance of his influence over his young audience, I have seen him become well-read, health-conscious, rational in times of chaos, and get married. His moral standards and development as a person are things to aspire to.
