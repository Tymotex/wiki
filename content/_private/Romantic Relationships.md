## Statistics
The most reliable predictor of divorce/separation is *contempt*, 'the feeling that a person or a thing is worthless or beneath consideration'.

There is a well-known 'magic ratio' of positive to negative interactions. It's said that couples falling below 5:1 positive to negative interactions tend to fall apart, but it's also said that couples exceeding 11:1 positive to negative interactions also tend to fall apart. There needs to be a realistic balance of bliss and conflict.

## Repairing and Apologising
Things I've observed to work well:
- Smiling genuinely, making them laugh and reminding them of why I love them.
- Recording all the things I love about them.

## Giving Feedback
TODO.

## Conflicts
- Never get defensive.

A good rule for ensuring both people feel heard and understood: "Each person can speak up for themselves *only after* they have first restated the ideas and feelings of the previous speaker accurately *and to that speaker's satisfaction*."
