## Cold Approaching
**Don’t think, just go.** The sooner you go, the better. Get out of your head, you won’t be any more prepared after you get jacked or shredded, that’s too long away.
- Try get a friend who’s also into developing themselves to go with you on cold approaches.
- You should think of all the reasons why you’re scared and debunk them:
    - You’re not going to see this girl again.
    - You are a polite, reserve and respectful person. You won’t be received as a creep — you’ll be a shy and awkward nerd at worst.
    - Remember, the goal of this is personal development. Rejection is winning. Keep that in mind and the load should be lifted from your shoulders. Only good can come of this.
    - They're just a 110-pound sack of flesh and bones. They're just as gross as you too.

## Game

### The Approach
After introducing yourself, just say the first thing that comes to your head. That's it. Don't go in with a script, this is part of the development.

Don't have any expectations. Just be present and curious.

### Conversation

Literally just voice the first thing that comes to mind, even if it's odd.

For getting-to-know-them questions, remember FORD:
- **Family**
    - 
- **Occupation**
    - What did you want to do as a kid?
- **Recreation**
- **Dreams**

## Dates
### Checklist
- Hygiene:
	- No bad breath.
	- No body odour.
	- Nails (finger and toes) should be short and clean.
	- Shower.
- Style:
	- Use strong hold hair products to style your hair (this tip is specific to me).
	- Wear boxer briefs that make you feel confident.
- Scent:
	- Use deodorant or cologne.
- What to bring:
	- Mints. They'd probably appreciate one too.
	- Two sources of money: credit/debit card and cash. Having just one source is unreliable and you may need to spill over to the other source.
- Preparation:
	- Ensure the place you planned to go to is actually open. Make a reservation to guarantee a spot.
	- Refresh on [[_private/Dating#Conversation|conversation starters]].
	- Scout out the place beforehand if the area is new to you. Ensure you don't get lost on the day.
	- Transportation... TODO.
	- Get a bicep, shoulder and chest pump right before you leave.

During the date:
- Speak in a lower tone.
- Speak slower and louder.
- How to smoothly hold her hands? Literally just take them when it feels appropriate. *If she knows she's on a date with you, she probably wants to hold your hand too*. If that fails, abort. Nothing would have happened anyway.

### Ideas
For first dates, optimise for chances to get to know her (i.e. prefer interactive dates, so no movies).
- Prefer smaller, local restaurants over fancier restaurants

### First Kiss
When it feels like you're really close, just ask.
