## Cold Approaching
**Don’t think, just go.** The sooner you go, the better. Get out of your head, you won’t be any more prepared after you get jacked or shredded, that’s too long away.
- Try get a friend who’s also into developing themselves to go with you on cold approaches.
- You should think of all the reasons why you’re scared and debunk them:
    - You’re not going to see this girl again.
    - You are a polite, reserve and respectful person. You won’t be received as a creep — you’ll be a shy and awkward nerd at worst.
    - Remember, the goal of this is personal development. Rejection is winning. Keep that in mind and the load should be lifted from your shoulders. Only good can come of this.
    - They're just a 110-pound sack of flesh and bones. They're just as gross as you too.

## Game

### The Approach
After introducing yourself, just say the first thing that comes to your head. That's it. Don't go in with a script, this is part of the development.

Don't have any expectations. Just be present and curious.

### Conversation

Literally just voice the first thing that comes to mind, even if it's odd.

For getting-to-know-them questions, remember FORD:
- **Family**
    - 
- **Occupation**
    - What did you want to do as a kid?
- **Recreation**
- **Dreams**
