## Hugging


## Kissing
Tips:
- Women kiss you the way they want to be kissed themselves. Follow their rhythm.
- Slow and sensual.
- What to do with your hands:
	- Lightly graze her cheek with your hands and hold gently under her ear, around the back of her scalp.
		  ![[_private/assets/kissing-hand-position.png|200]]
	 - Pull her in with the other arm with your hand on the lower back or waist, as if you're hugging her.
	 - Pull her in using her belt loop.
	 - Pull her neck in
- Start gentle, like a butterfly landing on a petal.
- Don't pucker your lips too hard, just part them. Apply very light suction when your lips meet.
- Kiss their jawline, collarbone, ears.
- Biting â€” gently tug on their lower lip with your teeth.
- Breaking off an maintaining eye contact is hot.
- Don't drool into their mouth, swallow when you need to.

You should remember to kiss other areas, especially erogenous zones.
- Kiss her on the forehead for comfort.

Kissing horizontally after pushing her down:
- You're free to do things with your hands to escalate:
	- Caress her face.
	- Hold her thighs.
	- Roam her hips and butt.
 - Take your shirt off and have your bare skin in contact with each other.

### French Kissing
- Start by licking their lips gently, or touching the tip of their tongue. Back off after initial contact, treat it like flirting; just give them a taste to see how they react.
- When her tongue is in your mouth, 'grab' it with your lips and suck.

### Neck Kissing
- Keep your lips hydrated throughout. Use chapstick or just lick them.
- How to start it:
	- Slowly work your way to the neck. Kiss her cheek, chin, ears, behind the ear, etc. slowly along the journey to the neck.
	- Peck her on the neck and look at her flirtatiously.
- Where to kiss:
	- The most sensitive area is where the neck connects with the shoulder. This is a great place to concentrate your efforts.
	- The nape is another sensitive area.
- How to kiss on the neck:
	- Open your mouth and suck.
	- Slow, wet kisses. Slower than you would if you were to kiss her lips. As you do this, touch your tongue to her neck.
	- Gently bite her.
	- Pull back and stare at her. It's hot.
- What to do with your hands:
	- Hold her face and caress.
	- Touch her hips occasionally.
 - Interesting tips:
	 - Gently blow on the wet spots to give them chills.

## Initiating Sex
- You must remove the barriers to sex: which is mainly stress and anxiety.

## Cunnilingus
- How to initiate it:
	- All women like to be eaten out and fucked. You just need to make them beg for it. Make them very hot and bothered.
	- **You must take your time with building anticipation**. Never rush, always err on the side of patience. 
		- Even when she begs to be fucked, be resolute in taking your time.
	1. Begin by making out with her. Do it like she's the last girl on Earth.
	2. Grab her hips firmly under her shirt. Feel strong and assertive.
	3. Take off her shirt.
	4. Begin the journey downwards: start from the neck, then chest (not boobs), then cleavage.
	5. Take her bra off. Do not make a beeline to the nipples.
	6. ... Continue from her: http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/t7ez2/quick_question_regarding_giving_women_oral_sex/c4k8iph. This is the best resource out there, probably.
- How to do it:
	- **Always go softly**. If she wants it harder, she'll pull your head closer or tell you.
	- Once she wants it harder, use long, broad strokes using as much surface area of your tongue as possible. She'll feel every bump and groove of your tongue.
	- Suck on her clit. Put your mouth around it like you're taking a bite out of an apple. Pretend it's a flaccid penis and suck it.
	- Alternate between licking and sucking the clit, labia minora and labia majora. They're all super sensitive.
		- Consider also moving back to the inner thigh and licking, sucking, biting there.
	- Get your teeth out of the way when sucking on her clit. It's not pleasant.
	- **Tease her**.
		- While you're kissing or nibbling skin on her thighs, trail right to her labia, then act like you're going to get to it, but then slowly move past it while exhaling hot breath onto her.
	 - Watch Nina Hartley's instructional video: https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph5712f4fcadf9c. You can literally pinch her clit around the hood, rub, wiggle, etc. to jerk her off. 
	 - Put two fingers into her, to fill in the 'hungry' spot. Just leave them inside, you don't need to do anything with them. She can use her muscles against your fingers.
	 - Massage her pussy and around it.

## Anatomy
![[_private/assets/vagina-diagram.png|600]]

- The clitoral glans has pretty much the same number of nerve endings as a penis. It's very sensitive. The smaller it is, the more sensitive it is
- Think of labia majora as the 'big outer lips' and the labia minora as the 'small inner lips'.
- The labia majora will conceal most of everything.

## Fingering
- **Don't jab**. Don't poke.

## Talking Dirty
- Make them laugh. It works just as well during sex as outside of it.
