## Hugging


## Kissing
Tips:
- Women kiss you the way they want to be kissed themselves. Follow their rhythm.
- Slow and sensual.
- What to do with your hands:
	- Lightly graze her cheek with your hands and hold gently under her ear, around the back of her scalp.

	 - Pull her in with the other arm with your hand on the lower back or waist, as if you're hugging her.
	 - Pull her in using her belt loop.
	 - Pull her neck in
- Start gentle, like a butterfly landing on a petal.
- Don't pucker your lips too hard, just part them. Apply very light suction when your lips meet.
- Kiss their jawline, collarbone, ears.
- Biting â€” gently tug on their lower lip with your teeth.
- Breaking off an maintaining eye contact is hot.
- Don't drool into their mouth, swallow when you need to.

You should remember to kiss other areas, especially erogenous zones.
- Kiss her on the forehead for comfort.

Kissing horizontally after pushing her down:
- You're free to do things with your hands to escalate:
	- Caress her face.
	- Hold her thighs.
	- Roam her hips and butt.
	- 

### French Kissing
- Start by licking their lips gently, or touching the tip of their tongue. Back off after initial contact, treat it like flirting; just give them a taste to see how they react.
- When her tongue is in your mouth, 'grab' it with your lips and suck.

### Neck Kissing
- Keep your lips hydrated throughout. Use chapstick or just lick them.
- How to start it:
	- Slowly work your way to the neck. Kiss her cheek, chin, ears, etc. slowly along the journey to the neck.
	- Peck her on the neck and look at her flirtatiously.
- Where to kiss:
	- The most sensitive area is where the neck connects with the shoulder. This is a great place to concentrate your efforts.
	- The nape is another sensitive area.
- How to kiss on the neck:
	- Open your mouth and suck.
	- Slow, wet kisses. Slower than you would if you were to kiss her lips. As you do this, touch your tongue to her neck.
	- Gently bite her.
	- Pull back and stare at her. It's hot.
- What to do with your hands:
	- Hold her face and caress.
	- Touch her hips occasionally.
 - Interesting tips:
	 - Gently blow on the wet spots to give them chills.
