## Memories
- When I saw her for the first time in Google Meet during the internship, I thought she was cute.
- When I saw her intern presentation, I thought she was a put-together person.
- When I bumped into her on Level 5 and we awkwardly waved at each other because at that point we hadn't spoken.
- When we spoke directly for the first time on the Google graduate road trip. I thought she was attractive, interesting and had similar interests. I hadn't fallen for her then, but the seed was planted and I was keen to know her more.
- When I 'rescued' her after she'd forgotten her badge and we had engaging conversation.
- When she invited me bouldering and I was happy that she did. On the bus ride back, I embarrassingly revealed that I had read 'Models' by Mark Manson.
- When we walked home together and learned about each other's autism (through the odd tile-stepping compulsion we both have).
- When she confided in me about the distasteful rumours about her spread by the other Google graduates. When she said that she trusted and had a good opinion of me.
- When I left the other Google graduates during breakfast so that I could join her instead, and she realised that and sent me really heartwarming messages telling me I was kind. She sent me a heart emoji and I was buzzing for the rest of the day.
- When she invited me to an exhausting 2-day volunteering event where high schoolers competed in an international robotics competition. I had so much time to just talk with her deeply, explore the Macquarie Uni campus, bond over shared interests and views. By this point, I fell for her so hard. I was so sleep deprived, thinking about her.
- When I confessed my feelings to her, at the Top Ryde bus stop. She spent so long deliberating about what to say, but eventually said yes. She had literally written up notes and used a spreadsheet to reason through her feelings for me.
- When we were on the bus together, comparing calluses, and I had decided to be bold and surprise her by holding her hand. How flustered she was after that, and how massively my ego inflated from winning against her.
- When we went out on our first date. We met at 12:30pm at the Gladesville bus stop and awkwardly flirted with each other. She told me I looked nice and I looked away out of embarrassment. We rode the bus and I made her hold my hand - my first win in the date. We wandered around Kinokuniya, talking about books, then walked to the Royal Botanic Garden, passing through Hyde Park, and briefly visiting the Art Gallery near the entrance of the Garden. We walked around aimlessly for a while before sitting on a park bench for some pleasant, deep conversation. We left the Gardens, checked out the Opera House for a while, taking in the view together. We stopped at the wharfs in Circular Quay after having decided to take the ferry. We asked a kind lady how to ride the ferry to Darling Harbour. We sat on the upper deck of the ferry and had a nice tour across the Sydney harbour. When we got off, we walked towards Darling Square and had dinner at Nakano Darling. There, she told me a bit about her dark past and I wept softly for a bit, thinking about the suffering she had to endure, and how it was so similar to what my mum went through. I gave her a spare hoodie I packed, and we walked across the Darling Harbour bridge (I had always fantasised about holding the hand of a girl I liked and walking across it at night, through the long lanes of dimly lit street lights). We stopped halfway across the bridge to take in the view of Darling Harbour. We'd stay there until 8:30PM when people gathered around the bridge and harbour to see the fireworks (apparently it was a regular thing that happened every Saturday at 8:30pm). It was so beautiful, I held her from behind and she held my hand. Afterwards however, we were both overcame with emotion when she revealed that she had a negative stance towards kids. I felt my heart sink at the prospect of ending it with her right there and then. We sat in the freezing cold for what felt like an hour as we deliberated about what this difference would mean for us. I saw her cry and I was struggling as I held back tears. Finally, I suggested we get out of the cold, and my god that was the most intense cold either of us had experience. Even with the spare hoodie, she was freezing. Survival mode kicked in and we worked together to find places where we could warm up. It was a seriously fun experience, and genuinely uncomfortable. We went to a convenience store on the side of the road across from 'The Little Snail' where we got some reprieve, then lightly jogged to the Star where we finally were able to warm up. We sat there for a good while, there we had much more lighthearted conversation and were more optimistic about our relationship. We then went home together on the 500x. I arrived home past midnight. I think that'll be the most memorable date for a long time, if not my whole life. 
- When we talked through our feelings the day after our first date together at her place. I made the mistake of sexually escalating with her prematurely, but I got an exciting glimpse of someone I'd have so much chemistry with in bed.
- When I made the mistake of telling my parents about her family situation, then they made assertions about how I'd never be happy with her and that I should break up with her as soon as I could to prevent unnecessary suffering.
- When she told me I made her upset, and how guilty and disappointed in myself I was after hearing that. I promised thereafter to not make that kind of mistake again, and I intend to honour that promise. My opinion of myself is seriously on the line from this point on.
