1. Cleanser
    - Prefer a hydrating cleanser.
2. Exfoliator
    - Exfoliation (the removal of dead skin cells) is usually considered unnecessary. Avoid if you have sensitive skin.
3. Moisturiser
4. Sunscreen
    - This matters long-term because of photoaging.
    - Prefer broad-spectrum sunscreen. Both UVA and UVB rays are damaging.
    - SPF (sun protection factor) is a measure of protection effectiveness.
        - In the lab, SPF is a rough measure of how long it would take for the sun to cause sunburn on protected skin vs. non-protected skin. An SPF 30 sunscreen would let you stay 30 times longer under the sun before you burn.
        - SPF 30 is not twice as good as SPF 15. The protective effects are diminishing.
    - Wash off sunscreen before sleeping to prevent clogged pores.

Switch pillowcases regularly.
