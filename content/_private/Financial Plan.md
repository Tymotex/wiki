Below is my personal finance plan.

#### Bank Accounts
I migrated from CommBank to ING in mid-2022 since they're an online bank with zero fees. They also have a competitive savings interest rate due to their lower operational costs.

| Emergency Funds | Savings  |        | 0%                                 | Funds for life's major tragedies (injuries, car damage, theft, etc.). Never to be touched for anything else. It's recommended to hold this account at a different institution.                                                                                                                                         | 

**Explanation**:
Given that I'm not living independently, I can allocate:
- $100 to **survival** since my only expenses are transport costs and phone bills. 
- 3% to **splurge** since I naturally have a low propensity to spend on non-essentials.
- 7% to **career capital** because most of my goods are *durable* and I've acquired all the equipment that I need to work for the next several years. When I have leftover funds in this account, I'll dump it all into the investment account.
- 0% to **emergency funds** because I can rely on my family to provide emergency financial support.
- The remainder goes into **investment**. I designed this plan with the aim to maximise the amount I put here.

**Financial Goals**:
My aim is simply to invest aggressively in my early-mid 20s to build up money. I don't have a particular target amount I want to reach or a certain date to achieve it by. I am currently thinking of cutting down on risky investments to save for a home deposit in my late 20s or early 30s.

TODO: I need to consider *how much is enough*. I should have a target date for achieving an amount of money I deem sufficient for financial independence (see the 4% rule).
