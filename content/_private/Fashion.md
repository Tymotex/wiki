I like dark red, dark blue (navy?), black (not pitch black), grey white.


TODO:
- Casual but also formal shoes for work
- Button shirt that isn't too formal
- Lighter jacket. Bomber jacket with collar? 
    - I love jackets with collars.
    - Harrington jacket.

- What's a dress shirt taper?
- What is my personality and message to the world?
- Should I go to a tailor?
- Cowl neck hoodies?
- Racer jacket?

## Principles
- **Shirts**
	- Optimal fit is the most important thing to get right.
	    - The shoulder seams is most important to get right. Tailors can help fix other areas well.
	- Avoid logos, prints, etc.
- **Socks**
	- Match sock colour with pant colour, going a little darker on the socks.
