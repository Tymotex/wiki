I like dark red, dark blue (navy?), black (not pitch black), grey white.


TODO:
- Casual but also formal shoes for work
- Button shirt that isn't too formal
- Lighter jacket. Bomber jacket with collar?
    - I love jackets with collars.
- What's a dress shirt taper?
- What is my personality and message to the world?
- Should I go to a tailor?
- Cowl neck hoodies?

- Optimal fit is the most important thing to get right.
- Avoid logos, prints, etc.
