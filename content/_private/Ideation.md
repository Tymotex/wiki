## App Ideas
**Obsidian Flashcard Generation with AI**
- Look through a given note, extract out flashcards.

**Habit tracker that properly gamifies things.**
- Procedurally generate a world/island/ecosystem that grows based on the person's performance. Trees start growing, towns start emerging when the person does well. Terrain starts becoming barren and graveyards spawn when the person becomes negligent.
- Widget for easy progress logging.
- Graph visualisation.
- Weekly email digests.
- Timer and stopwatch that logs activities (like Forest).
- Web and mobile interfaces.

**An extensible When2Meet clone.** 
This might be a great beginning app to try making before launching more ambitious projects. This would be useful as a replacement to When2Meet, which is already widespread and lacks competitors.
- Launch a prototype, then rope in friends.
- Timeweave features.
- As a user, you get a list of 20 events that you can manage in a master list. This is stored locally and can be synced if you log in.
    - They'll persist for some time before being automatically deleted. They get archived if you're logged in.
- Ephemerald features. Also draw inspiration from locational apps like Pokemon Go â€” be suggested events by a rec engine that you can go to.

**Meal planning automation**
Based on your specific diet goals, generates a grocery list and weekly meal plan. This probably exists and has too many competitors.
