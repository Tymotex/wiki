## Hugging


## Kissing
Tips:
- Women kiss you the way they want to be kissed themselves. Follow their rhythm.
- Slow and sensual.
- What to do with your hands:
	- Lightly graze her cheek with your hands and hold gently under her ear, around the back of her scalp.

	 - Pull her in with the other arm with your hand on the lower back or waist, as if you're hugging her.
	 - Pull her in using her belt loop.
	 - Pull her neck in
- Start gentle, like a butterfly landing on a petal.
- Don't pucker your lips too hard, just part them. Apply very light suction when your lips meet.
- Kiss their jawline, collarbone, ears.
- Biting â€” gently tug on their lower lip with your teeth.
- Breaking off an maintaining eye contact is hot.
- Don't drool into their mouth, swallow when you need to.

You should remember to kiss other areas, especially erogenous zones.
- Kiss her on the forehead for comfort.

### French Kissing
- Start by licking their lips gently, or touching the tip of their tongue. Back off after initial contact, treat it like flirting; just give them a taste to see how they react.
- When her tongue is in your mouth, 'grab' it with your lips and suck.
