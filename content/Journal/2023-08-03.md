# Thoughts
I really want my sleep to get better. I really want my respiration and cardiovascular fitness to get better.

I've been thinking about Jiaru and sex so much. I will be patient, I will take my time to make sure we're both comfortable with each other, then we'll have a great relationship. I know I have rose-tinted glasses on right now. There'll be plenty we dislike about each other. Just enjoy this moment. How amazing it feels to be in love.
