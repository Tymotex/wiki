# Thoughts
Some useful thoughts:
- I feel like a burden is lifted off of me when I don't have to prepare for meetings right before them. E.g. Today is Sunday and I've written what I'm going to say in the meetings tomorrow and the day after.
- I feel like I would be much more productive and produce better quality work if I were to just pick one thing to focus on and just do that.

I did my first ever kinda interval run. It was seriously painful.

# List three personal beliefs that you’re willing to reconsider or further explore.
- Anything related to dating. I need to experience it before I draw conclusions about the state of things.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
That I care about exercise and health.
