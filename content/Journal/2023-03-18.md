# Thoughts
I finished Divinity Original Sin 2 for the first time today. I had to cheat a bit to get through the final bullshit fight. Wow. That game definitely is up there in my top 5 games of all time. The music is incredible. The romance arc with Sebille is especially good. I feel satisfied with the ending, knowing that my character has freed himself and Sebille from divinity and vengeance. What happens after goes like this in my mind:
- We travel together to the Elven homelands, get married, build a sanctuary for ourselves and have children. We find a community there that we value and protect.
- We explore the lands of Rivellon, helping those in need, continuing our adventures as mage and assassin.
- Eventually when in-fighting amongst the elves develop, we support the side against vying for power and calling for genocide of non-elves.
- We die in each other's arms, in the ripest point of the golden age we ushered in, in the sanctuary we built, surrounded by our children and friends.
