> \"No great thing is created suddenly.\" â€” Epictetus

# Thoughts
Write about Rimworld and gaming urges.

Write about book notes and how long they are taking. What can you change?

# What is an accomplishment you're very proud of? Why are you proud of it? What can you do to do more things like that?

# One Thing You're Grateful For
