# Thoughts
I feel myself getting really frustrated by Raymond. I know he's not a bad guy, in fact, nothing about him really gives me any reason to dislike him. I just feel annoyed by some of his characteristics.. I really got annoyed when he would go on about his insecurities. I don't like that he seems lazier than me. I don't like that he tries to get me to game and talk with him. I feel really off about him. I think it'd better to just distance myself and make it clear I'm not so interested in hanging out.

# What three important things have you learned from previous relationships?
That emotional stability is the one of the most important traits both in my partner and myself. That I am so much better off improving myself and being selfish about it for the earlier parts of my life, at least. That I have a long way to go before I become attractive to the girl of my dreams, ie. I have so much more to work hard on.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
Learning investing now, rather than a year or more from now.
