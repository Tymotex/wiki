# Thoughts
I had several moments of weakness today. I felt an intense craving for gaming. I just wanted something really 'cozy' like Stardew Valley. I resisted, mostly, although in part it was because there were no options better than Stardew Valley. I also felt really weak when I had to do my sets of squats today. I didn't do 5 sets, but I did do a few improv sets of 120kg. I masturbated again today, unfortunately. It really doesn't make me feel better. At the very least, I didn't use porn or other visual stimulus, so it feels a little less regrettable than otherwise.

# What difficult thoughts or emotions come up most frequently for you?
Weakness and thoughts of receding to my comforts. This is perhaps the hardest impulse to battle against.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
My angelfish, and in particular my mum's love for it too.
