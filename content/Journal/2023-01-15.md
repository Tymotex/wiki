# Thoughts
I should be kinder to mum when I get back from work, no matter how drained I am. I should gently tell her that I prefer not to urged on what to do and that I find it frustrating. I should not express annoyance and comply resentfully.

I find mum adorable, especially her story about the turtles in the Centennial Park peeking their head out above the water looking for food, swimming towards you, then peeking their head out again. I love that she adores our angelfish.

# Do you see yourself in the same job in 10 years?
Yes, although I'd love to jump around and gain skills beyond what I'm currently required to do.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
My aunt, for painting so much for us and wanting to be conservative with food wastage. She's overall so great to us. I wish we could do more for her.
