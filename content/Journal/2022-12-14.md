# Thoughts
Same problem as yesterday, but I did a little better. Now the app is deployed, finally. I cut so many things, but at least it's deployed and I can start to move on to other things.

# Explore an opinion or two that you held in the past but have since questioned or changed. What led you to change that opinion?
Veganism was something I was pretty opposed to. I remember first hearing about it for real through Joanna and I recall being a bit disappointed about it, thinking she was probably really uptight and morally righteous. I wasn't exactly wrong, but I am glad that I was open-minded enough to learn more about it over time. Now after reading a book on the subject, I am convinced that it is a very respectable lifestyle choice and hope to follow it at least partially in my life. I also realised that eating meat is a direct contradiction to my values. I don't think I am okay with animals suffering and would not consume meat if I had to see the animal being slaughtered for it myself.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
Teng. He's the best brother I could ask for.
