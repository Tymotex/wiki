# Thoughts
Today was a bit of wild day.

Last night, I kept thinking about Jenny... What is wrong with me. I just think of the way she waves to me in the morning, how that makes my heart melt and pound a bit faster. I keep replaying a scenario of how I'm going to awkwardly ask her out. At this point, it would be genuinely quite painful if she doesn't feel the same way about me. In truth, I'm not so confident she's the right match for me, but I am seriously smitten by her at the moment. I will absolutely be asking her out. I will take rejection gracefully. I tend to inflate reality, I should assume she's just naturally interested in people, not just me.

Also, there was Citadel event that a lot of Google interns flocked to last night. Jenny went to that and met Arthur. I'm so flattered that she told me today that Arthur thought of me as one of his best friends. He's never communicated that way to me before, so that means so much to me. I'm glad I have that guy in my life. I should definitely invite him out more.
