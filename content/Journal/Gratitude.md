## Starters
- Hundreds of people are diagnosed with cancer every day in Australia alone. Plenty of more people are subject to life-changing tragedies and catastrophes every day. Think about how you would feel if you or a loved one were struck with such an event and how utterly grateful you'd feel if you were to be transported back to this very moment. It would feel as if all your prayers had been answered, *just to be where you are currently*.
- Think about the last time you did something. When there is something you dread doing, realise that there will only ever be a finite number of times this would happen. How would your mindset change if you were told this would be the last time to do the thing? For example, this could be the last time you ever called a friend, the last time you ever went to a park with your parents, etc.
