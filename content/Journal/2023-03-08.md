> \"Give yourself a gift, the present moment.\" â€” Marcus Aurelius

# Thoughts
The traffic is so bad at 7pm. It was also particularly bad at around 5:30pm. I suppose the optimal time might be very close to 5pm or 6pm?

I actually really like the grad cohort at Google. They're pretty sociable and I can learn to be a little better in that domain from them.

# What values do you consider most important in life (honesty, justice, altruism, loyalty, etc.)? How do your actions align with those values?
Honesty. I still think that book from Sam Harris was incredible.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
Reading.
