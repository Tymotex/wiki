# Thoughts
I'm a bit ashamed that I spent more than an hour today watching breaking bad scenes. I feel so inept with investing, but I know that I will get better.

# What do you fear most? Have your fears changed throughout life?
I fear most my cowardice, ironically. I also fear mediocrity and not accomplishing at least 1 or a few remarkable things in my life. They've changed in that I've not had these kinds of fears a few years ago.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
That I get to spend time with mum and dad before life gets busier.
