# Thoughts
I'm about to pop up to Cleo and my heart rate is spiking massively. Wow, I underestimated how much this would get me worked up. This is great though, just remember that you are doing this for self-improvement. You're indifferent to the result. Seriously, she's just one girl. If it works out, fantastic, if it doesn't, fantastic. You'd even prefer that it falls flat and doesn't develop.

Here's what's going to happen: you send her that really brief opener expressing honest curiosity about her life. You continue the conversation naturally and then when appropriate, you point out that it'd be nice to get to know her better. Organise a date that works. Done. If she's taken, done. If not interested, done. Seriously. That's it. Then you move on with your life.

What's the worst
