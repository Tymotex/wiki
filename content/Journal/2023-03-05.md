# Thoughts
I get so annoyed whenever my mum complains about something, like being tired. I hate that she lies in bed for long each day. I hate that she's glued to the TV for so long each day. I hate that she makes excuses for eating poorly and not exercising. I get annoyed whenever my dad smokes indoors, putting mum and I's health at risk. Fuck off.

I love them but it's hard to see them be this way.
