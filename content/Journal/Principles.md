>"Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one." â€” Marcus Aurelius.

## Principles
- **Be a good man**. Live by your principles as best as you can, be uncompromisingly honest, seek virtue in others and forgive their vices.
- **Amor fati** (love of fate). Accept all things as they unfold.
- **Temperance** and rationality. Never be a puppet to pleasure or pain.
- **Hard work, adversity, discomfort and suffering** are your sources of meaning.
- **First in line for duty, last in line for recognition**.
- **Open your heart and give relentlessly**, especially the things you hold dearest or desire the most.
