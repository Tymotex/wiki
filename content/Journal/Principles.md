>"Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one." â€” Marcus Aurelius.

## Principles
- Be a good man. Never think yourself greater than another person. Hold promises, live by your principles as best as you can, seek virtue in others and forgive their vices.
- Amor fati. Accept all things as they unfold.
- Temperance. Never be a puppet to pleasure or aversion to pain.
- Hard work, adversity, discomfort and suffering are sources of meaning.
- 

1. I love my family and will do anything for them. I know that becoming the best version of myself is the most reliable way to make them and myself happy.
2. I am conscientious, orderly and disciplined.
6. I am open-minded and love thinking deeply about things. I find many things extremely interesting and beautiful.
7. I am fearless.
8. I am physically strong and fit. I love being healthy and I'm willing to sacrifice a lot to stay such.
9. I am not a lavish spender and will always prefer to not spend money on things that don't directly improve my life or capacity to learn and work. I am not a victim of lifestyle creep.
10. I am a giving person, even when I am the most deprived.
11. I always do the right thing, not for recognition or for personal benefit. I do it because I feel deeply shameful otherwise and believe life is more meaningful that way.
12. I strive to implement the processes and character necessary to be wealthy because I love experiencing life to the fullest and especially giving that my loved ones.
