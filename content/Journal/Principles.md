2. I am conscientious, orderly and disciplined.
3. I am stoic.
4. I am a lifelong learner.
5. I love challenge and suffering.
6. I am open-minded and love thinking deeply about things. I find many things extremely interesting and beautiful.
7. I am fearless.
8. I am physically strong and fit. I love being healthy and I'm willing to sacrifice a lot to stay such.
9. I am not a lavish spender and will always prefer to not spend money on things that don't directly improve my life or capacity to learn and work. I am not a victim of lifestyle creep.
10. I am a giving person, even when I am the most deprived.
11. I always do the right thing, not for recognition or for personal benefit. I do it because I feel deeply shameful otherwise and believe life is more meaningful that way.
