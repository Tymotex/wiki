>"Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one." — Marcus Aurelius.

## Principles
Following these principles makes my life meaningful.
1. I love my family and will do anything for them. I know that becoming the best version of myself is the most reliable way to make them and myself happy.
2. I am conscientious, orderly and disciplined.
3. I am stoic.
4. I am a lifelong learner.
5. I love challenge and suffering.
6. I am open-minded and love thinking deeply about things. I find many things extremely interesting and beautiful.
7. I am fearless.
8. I am physically strong and fit. I love being healthy and I'm willing to sacrifice a lot to stay such.
9. I am not a lavish spender and will always prefer to not spend money on things that don't directly improve my life or capacity to learn and work. I am not a victim of lifestyle creep.
10. I am a giving person, even when I am the most deprived.
11. I always do the right thing, not for recognition or for personal benefit. I do it because I feel deeply shameful otherwise and believe life is more meaningful that way.
12. I strive to implement the processes and character necessary to be wealthy because I love experiencing life to the fullest and especially giving that my loved ones.

## Heroes
These are the people I aspire to be like. The attribute I venerate in each of these people is their mental toughness and temperance.

Goggins proves to me that it's possible to push yourself through what seems like insurmountable pain. Knowing that a person like him exists has made think about how much of a little bitch I really am. I've become aware and disgusted towards my weaker self because of him, and it has helped me to bring out a superior man out of me.
