# Thoughts
Today I saw the Great Barrier Reef for the first and possibly last time in my life. 

I was so incredibly frustrated at my parents. They were merely meters away from seeing probably the most beautiful thing on Earth, and they refused to go see it. I get so fucking mad thinking about how unsafe they think things are. I really want to just leave them and live independently whenever they let baseless fears affect their lives, and especially when they force me into their beliefs. Just shut the fuck up, please. I hate how stubborn they are. I love them, but I can't stand them when it comes to these kinds of things. I refuse to ever travel for fun with them again. I'll enjoy their company in other ways, just not through travel. **Seriously, I never want to be around them again for travel**. It makes me sad to say this, but I fucking hate that I feel constrained living with them. 

I feel like such a fucking child around them. If this persists across 2023, I will definitely move out. Right now, the things bugging me the most are the constant interruptions throughout the day. I will not listen to them in the future.

Mum, but only to the extent of having me in her best interests.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
Getting to see the Great Barrier Reef, one of the few things I've always really wanted to see.
