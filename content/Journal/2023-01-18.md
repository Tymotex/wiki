# Thoughts
I find myself so drawn to women. I had a long conversation with Yue today and it just felt so good to look into her eyes and feel her feminine energy. When I don't masturbate, it feels especially good. I feel a bit conflicted, she's not the only woman I'm drawn towards. This is good though, I love that I love women.

I also found out that my SWE project during my internship caused no problems. Thank god. I was afraid it'd throw a load of errors towards Yue and Nick.

# What three important things have you learned from previous relationships?
- I'm nowhere near as mature as I thought.
- Emotional intelligence and lower neuroticism is seriously important.
- You should be 100% honest and never tarnish that reputation.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
My job. The fact that I get to be around so many amazing people. And that I'll become the average of those amazing people and therefore be amazing myself one day.

Yue. She gave me this new life.
