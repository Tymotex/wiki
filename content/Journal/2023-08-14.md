## Thoughts
Think about what a great situation it is -- you have a great job, a great girlfriend, and you're on the trajectory to a healthy and rich life. You've got a girlfriend now, it's been a bit of a distraction but one that's very welcome, and now that you're official with her, it's time to settle back into your usual life of grinding to get better. This is one important area of your life you've paid attention to, now let's turn back towards the main purpose of your life. It's important to do this, to remain being the person she fell for. You must continue to grow, and you'll do so at a faster pace because of the person you've picked as your partner. You are happy with your choice and recognise that 'better' doesn't really exist, and even if it does, it's not something that you'd really want to pursue anyway. It's good enough and now you can focus on other things. It's such a great situation. Now go and get after it.
