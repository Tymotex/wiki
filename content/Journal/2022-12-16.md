# Thoughts
I feel so ashamed that I gave into porn and masturbation yesterday. I've said this so many times and I've never put an end to it. I started reading Discipline is Destiny today. My god, I have so much potential that I will never realise if I don't wrestle back control over my body and desires. I want to become like Lou Gehrig. I want to keep my ego entirely in check. I want to love what I do so much that I toil away at it day and night and break myself in the process. I want to perfect my body, to be strong, beautiful and healthy. 

Right now, I am scum. I need to cleanse myself.

# How do you make time for yourself each day?
I wish I had a schedule. I don't really go consciously make time for myself. Isn't that all day? Lol.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
ChatGPT. It actually helped me a lot today.
