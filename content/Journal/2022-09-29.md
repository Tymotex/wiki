I did squats 3 days ago and I am still so sore from it. That was the hardest workout in a long time and I'm proud to have suffered through it.

I get so annoyed thinking about Simon. Why does he think that his problems are significant enough to go to a psychologist? What suffering has he endured? All of his problems are purely by his own construction. Life would be better and he would be so much more respectable if he were to work hard at something meaningful, be more open-minded, and find beauty in something beyond gaming and porn. **I must not be like this kind of person**. I mustn't ever be around people who I simply grow to resent. The same applies to a person like David. Reese I respect more because he has demonstrated initiative and some pursuit of meaning. He exercises and has goals to strive towards - and actually does so. That's commendable. Arthur is also someone I respect - he loves what he does, possibly on the same level as I do, and he loves challenge as well. He is ambitious and will work hard to pursue goals. 

**Am I happy with today?**


**What can I do better?**


**What am I grateful for?**
