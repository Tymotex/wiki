# Thoughts
Got distracted in the morning sadly. I just had an urge to learn about Skyrim Requiem. I'm glad I didn't play games today. It is so much more satisfying to work instead.

I keep seeing attractive women around me everywhere I go. I just have to wait. It's not my time yet. My time will come, and only if I stay the course and continue building myself up as a man. I want to be a good man, a man that deserves love first. Right now, I deserve no love and my love is not valuable. Be patient and you'll have your time in the spotlight.

Meditating in the morning helps. Having done it once makes it more likely I'll recall that moment and then remember to be mindful. Other things that help are cold showers and waking up from naps.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
For being able to spend time with my aunt.
