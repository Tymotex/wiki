# Thoughts

I masturbated without porn today. I definitely don't feel as shameful about doing it, but I still feel drained and lethargic and hollow. It's still better to not ejaculate.

TODO: sleep is what's most important now.

TODO: write about this: You are choosing to be single. This nets you so many advantages over people not in relationships. Exploit them to their maximum.
