# Thoughts
Some overdue topics that I wanted to journal about from the past 2 weeks:
- About your interaction with your manager and other coworkers:
    - I'm not reaching out to people enough. I'm only just starting to do this more often and it's paying off. I should be pushing myself to ask dumb questions more often.
    - I need to make better use of my meetings with Andy. I should go in with a clear goal of what outcome I'd like from the interaction.
- Insecurity about appearance:
    - I don't know what to say anymore. Appearance doesn't matter as much as I believe it to, but I should still consider it important enough to try to optimise without going overboard. This means getting decent clothes that fit me, becoming muscular, having nicer haircuts, etc.
- Constantly think people are observing you:
    - This is a big problem in my life. I get self-conscious reading in public
