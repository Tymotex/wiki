# Thoughts
AFter starting work, I realise that the only thing holding me back from having an awesome workday is just my mind. If I were to feel slightly anxious, slightly pressed for time, I don't feel too tired in the afternoon and can power through more hurs than I normally do. I need to feel more urgency to get stuff done each day.

Today was a disappointing day in terms of work output. I spent the morning looking at jeans and blenders. What a waste of brainpower. 

I realise that I feel really happy when I don't masturbate for a while. This has nothing to do with porn anymore, I just notice that masturbating tones down my drive to go out there and take risks. I just want to stay home where it's comfortable and do something comforting. I have not felt nearly as strong an urge to bust nuts lately, after gaining greater awareness in how it degrades my motivation and life vigour.

Also, you need to stop being a skinny fuck. Gain weight, even if you have to eat more meat, dairy or whatnot. Eat cleanly, but stop stressing over nutrition. Keep eating your smoothies, your oats, beans, nuts, fruits, vegetables. That should be enough, then just wolf down your meat and other calorie/protein fillers.
