# Thoughts
Today I got to meet my team at Google. Man, life seems so good there, I definitely made the right choice. I feel like this is such a good setup for my life. I'm going to crush it there, and I'll make a bunch of close friends.

I can't help but have feelings for Yue. I find her so attractive. I will use her as my motivation to work hard, be more confident, and be a better man. She's my muse, my source of inspiration. When I feel like a weak little fucking degenerate, I'll think of her, and I will conquer anything.

# Describe your favorite thing to do when feeling low.
Talk to my mum. Without fail, I feel better.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
My job at Google. Holy crap, life is good because of it. I am so god damn lucky. No where else is that good.
