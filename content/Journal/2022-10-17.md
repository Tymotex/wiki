> \"Give yourself a gift, the present moment.\" â€” Marcus Aurelius

# Thoughts
I fucking hate going out and feeling like half the day was just gone. I wish I had gotten the chance to just stay focused at my tasks.

# What helps you stay focused and motivated when you feel discouraged?
My family. And the idea that I am slowing down in a race of all the men I'm competing with. I will beat them.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
For my conscientiousness. It's a gift, but I can always do better.
