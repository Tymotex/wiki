**Am I happy with today?**

I slept so much better last night. I think it was because I didn't look at screens much and because I got in bed before 9. I'll continue to do that.

**What can I do better?**


**What am I grateful for?**
Having a mum that can see when I am feeling under the weather and will do her best to console me and lift my mood.
