**Am I happy with today?**
Fairly. I went to a social sports event with a bunch of people. I felt pretty connected with the people there and I'm feeling pretty motivated to try more social meetups like that again. I was super reluctant beforehand and contemplated flaking. I'm glad that I didn't. Also, I feel guilty for spending so much time on my second brain. Just thining about it, all I have to do now, I believe, is just to migrate a few things:
- My backlog of ideas.
- My exercise routine table.
And get sync working. Then, I can be mostly free of Notion. Wow.

**What can I do better?**
I could stop being a coward and actually set and do the tasks that I feel a lot of resistance towards.

**What am I grateful for?**
I'm grateful that I have friends who invite me to things.
