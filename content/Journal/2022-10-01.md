# Thoughts
When I don't work on a project for a while (>= 1 week), I notice that I build up a lot of resistance towards starting that task again. It feels as if I left it in a state that I'm not proud of and that would be unpleasant to return to. I know that's not the case. I will always finish my projects, no matter what. I just want to knock out Konflux this week and then stop worrying about it for a while.

I find that writing my subtasks down on paper is very helpful. Recursively breaking down tasks seems like a universally good idea wherever you go, especially problem-solving and beating procrastination resistance.

I always wake up feeling a bit lethargic. I should be aggressive and get to bed well before 9 hours before my waking time.
