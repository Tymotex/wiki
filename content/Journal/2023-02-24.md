# Thoughts
Felt a bit guilty that I did not work all that much today. I think I really work better at home. I went to the office just to have meetings, eat food, take food home and leave. In the weekend, I'll make up for it.

I can't keep doing this though. Eventually, I'll have to settle to a more distinct equilibrium between work and life. I should take advantage of the fact that life is more relaxed at Google to fuel my life aspirations.

# When do you trust yourself most? When do you find it harder to have faith in your instincts?
When I've slept well and have momentum. When I lose both, I deteriorate and no longer trust myself, which only worsens my condition. I need momentum.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
That I've moved on from Jenny after a week. I can see now that I wasn't so into her, I just idealised her.
