# Thoughts
Bjarne Stroustrup. 

I'm always constantly a victim to Dunning Kruger. And the sad thing is that my knowing of that only makes me a greater victim of it.

Look to people like Lex Fridman. Be inspired to become like these great people. I should be constantly wearing myself out day to day. I should be ruthlessly learning.

I love computer science. I need to learn it deeply.
I have to learn to sit down for hours and learn computer science.

I'm proud of myself for beating my squat PR, going from 130kg to 135kg. I originally wanted to hit 140kg this year, but I'm happy with where I am now considering that I had some struggles with squatting for around 2 months and only recently started feeling stronger again. I hope to hit even bigger numbers by the end of next year.
