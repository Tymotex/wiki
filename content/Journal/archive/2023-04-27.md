# Thoughts
I thought of someone when I MOed yesterday. I literally wrote a goal to ask her out on a date. I immediately felt how awful of a match we'd be when the post MO clarity hit. But it's a only a day later and I'm interested in asking her out on a date again. This constantly horny state is the default, not the post MO clarity state. Perhaps it's not a bad idea to try asking her out eventually. If anything, it'd be good practice. I've never dated a girl like her, so I'd be trying something new and discovering more about what I should seek in a relationship.
