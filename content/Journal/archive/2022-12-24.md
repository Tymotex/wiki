# Thoughts
I am so frustrated with how I slept last night. I don't remember being so fucking pissed off about it. This isn't normal. I should journal about what's occupying my mind prior to sleep. I should spend as long as needed for that. I need to also wind down properly, rather than trying to compensate for all the work I didn't do over the day. I'm so irritated right now, and I haven't felt this way in a long time.

I'm even more disappointed in Simon now. That's what's occupied my mind. I am going to distance myself from him. He's destructive and irrational. 

Enough is enough. Why are you constantly thinking about him? What relevance does he have in your life? Shut the fuck up about it.

I fucking hate how weak I am. When am I going to grow the fuck up? I'm a pathetic thing.
