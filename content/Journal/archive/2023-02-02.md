# Thoughts
I did a talk on an ex-intern panel today. It was a really great decision. I felt really proud of myself for being able to make the crowd laugh pretty much every time I spoke. I felt great when people complimented me for the talk I gave.

I also had a long group chat with other interns in today's TGIF. I realised I probably have more chemistry with girls other than Jenny, but I still like her quite a lot. I'll see. I need more data points.
