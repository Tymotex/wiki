# Thoughts
Today was a really nice day because I got to spend a bit more time with Jenny. I'm so smitten by her. I was waiting to get cutlery and she placed some for me in my tray while we were in the cafetaria. What a sweet girl.

I really feel like there's a chance that the feelings I have for her might be mutual. I love the way she waves to me when she sees me. And that smile, I would give quite a lot to be able to see that more often.

Also, I asked her about Arthur calling me his best friend. I feel so touched that it was true. I'm really happy today.

I got a haircut last Saturday. I wasn't sure how she'd react but she was super cute about it telling me it was nice. What an adorable person.
