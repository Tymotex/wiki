# Thoughts
Today was an okay day, about the same as yesterday. I unfortunately really struggled in the morning due to diarrhea. This has happened quite frequently. I should start logging precisely what I eat day to day to figure out the probably causes.

I find it pretty hard to focus, but I think I will get better through practice.

# What do you most want to accomplish in life?
To be a good man and live virtuously, and to master my mind and body. To max out my real life skills of logic and athletics like in the Sims.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
My aunt.
