# Thoughts

Today I had the first focused morning in a long time, but I still am not that happy about how the day went overall. My mum and aunt were out of the house in the morning so I had some genuine peace and quiet and no distractions. For the first few hours, I was pretty laser focused and effective (although I do find it challenging not to have thoughts derail me as I read through a book that I find difficult to read).

I am mainly disappointed in all the menial chores I undertook after lunch when I could have put in a few more focused hours. I got sidetracked by watching a few videos on stoicism, which is not wasted time, however I failed to stick to a schedule. This is not the sort of thing I would be doing at work, for example. 

I honestly can't wait for work to wedge itself into my life, and for me to build a schedule around it. I think it's that regularity that provides a rhythm and foundation to my life.
