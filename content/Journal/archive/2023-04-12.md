# Thoughts
I went to the Noogler social event this evening. I was so close to bailing on it, but I remembered Scott Galloway's advice (which I listened to yesterday) which urged me to force myself to say yes to social opportunities. I am so happy I did. I got to know the other graduates a lot more, these are people I might see for years. I felt a connection with the people there. I was able to fucking speak, finally. I still need to learn to interject in conversation naturally. This was good, I should do it again.

I'm a little sad I am spending these days not seeing my mum and dad that often. I literally did not see my dad today. This is really sad. I need to remember I'm in the tail end of my time with them. I should cherish them more.

For listening to the advice I'm being given. I should speak out more at work, and say yes to the social opportunities when they arise, like today. I can feel myself improving from this, I just need to get a lot better and keep it up.
