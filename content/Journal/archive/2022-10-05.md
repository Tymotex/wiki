# Thoughts
I met that girl from Baulkham Hills yesterday. I thought she was really pretty. If I could have a girl with her looks as my girlfriend, I'd be really content. I should remember that girls like her are available to me, so long as I stay the course and avoid PMO. 

Also, today I got a perm for the first time and I hate it. I hope it grows out quickly. I'm glad that I made this mistake when it mattered the least, ie. right before work and just after university.

# What is one of your most cherished memories and why?
Supporting my mum during her visit to the eye doctor when we were scared about a detached retina. I felt so close to her and I felt so purposeful and happy despite the expected tragedy. I was so ready to step up as a man and carry the world for her. I strive to be that kind of person.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
That I feel immensely guilty and ashamed when I don't work hard. Working hard feels so good because it's meaningful to me.
