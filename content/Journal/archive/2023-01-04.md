# Thoughts
Today was okay but I still struggled with reddit and youtube. I'm getting a few hours in each day, but I could be working so much harder.

# Identify one area where you’d like to improve. Then, list three specific actions you can take to create that change.
Time management. 
- Get a fucking schedule and stick to it. I already do but I find it hard to stick with. Once I start work, I should treat 9-5 as sacred work time. I'll have lunch at 12 or whatever, but I won't fuck around during my 9-5.
- Go hard in the mornings.
- Get good sleep... It is so much less easy to derail yourself when you're laser sharp and feel great.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
That I put in the work to make my fish's lives better.
