# Thoughts
Shopping, commuting, cooking and eating are so depressingly time-consuming. It really took me half the day to accomplish all these things. I really need to optimise my time away from doing these things and only enjoy them as a very occasional luxury. If I need groceries, I should just tell mum. If I want to try a certain meal, I should only try it on a day where I plan to do less intensive and long work.

# Think of 12 year-old you. What “secrets of life” have you acquired that you would want to share with yourself?
Meaningful hard work and constantly increasing your own tree of knowledge are the among the most satisfying pursuits possible in life.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
My mum. She keeps mentioning how she is really happy. Her own gratitude for her life is infectious and I feel deeply grateful from it. Also her mannerisms are just overall adorable.
