> \"All we need to do are these three little duties—to try hard, to be honest, and to help ourselves and others.\" — Ryan Holiday

# Thoughts
I felt quite a strong urge to play Rimworld again. I'm not sure whether I'll play it again.

# What is one of your most cherished memories and why?
Stepping on stage and receiving the Dux award for years 11 and 12. I worked hard for that and I proved to myself that I could beat everyone and win.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
That my lifestyle doesn't consist of many bad habits other than PMO.
