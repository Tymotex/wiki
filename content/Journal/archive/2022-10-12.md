# Thoughts
All these personal finance and self-help books leave me feeling so hopeful for the future. I feel grateful knowing that I'm a really frugal person and that I'm mindful and disciplined about my money. I feel grateful knowing that I will be motivated to invest money, and that I'll see that money as units in a exponentially growing army of freedom fighters. I see frugality as a challenge to rise against, not a form of deprivation.

Also, I'm really glad I set up that automatic journal generation idea. I actually look forward to seeing what I get and it makes me introspect more deeply.

# Which emotions do you find hardest to accept (guilt, anger, disappointment, etc.)? How do you handle these emotions?
I find guilt/regret/shame, which are really all expressions of the same emotional distress, to be the hardest to accept. Anger, disappointment, sadness, these are all easier to control. Guilt is something that haunts me for years, and feels awful because I brought it upon myself. Perhaps the only consolation of this emotion is that it is a strong driver for me to never conduct myself in a certain way again.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
That I love reading, and leaning.
