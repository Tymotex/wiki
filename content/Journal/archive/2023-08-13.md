# Thoughts
(Writing this the day after.) Today was City2Surf, it felt so good to just run with the crowd, to swerve past people, to listen to my motivating music, to beat the pace that I had originally set myself (5:30 to 6:00, but I finished with 5:26). It felt amazing to finish that race and to have messaged Jiaru to meet up in the city.

I met up with Jiaru and Hiru at Uniqlo Mid City. I had pancakes with Jiaru at Gram, then we had photos and ate jianbing guozi and sushi. I crashed her place and we held each other. I asked her to be my girlfriend and we had heartfelt conversation about all the things we expect from each other.
