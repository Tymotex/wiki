> \"The best answer to anger is silence.\" â€” Marcus Aurelius

# Thoughts
TODO: think of all the times you've lied. How different could the world have been otherwise? How would you tactfully told the truth?

TODO: amend your principles to never lie.

# How do you show compassion to others? How can you extend that same compassion to yourself?

# One Thing You're Grateful For
