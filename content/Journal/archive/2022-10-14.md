# Thoughts
I feel so fucking sad because I feel like I have no control over influencing my parents wellbeing. I so desperately want them to be happy and healthy, but I get so frustrated when they complain about wanting to relax. It's not right, and I will not change my views on this. You must push yourself hard to stay in the game. I feel like they are so defeatist. I don't know what to do. I will encourage them towards better behaviours. I suppose the best I can do for now is just live up to my own standards consistently and hope that imparts something on them.

# List three personal beliefs that you’re willing to reconsider or further explore.
I'm just going to list one. I have some belief that women will only want me for my accomplishments and assets. I don't believe I'm lovable without those. Another belief I just thought of is that I should also find ways to make time for those things that are super meaningful to me, the things I really want to do before I die. I can't just grind away my 20s, even though a part of me finds that highly romantic or ideal.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
I'm grateful I kept up my morning routine quite consistently for months now. I can't recall the last day I skipped.
