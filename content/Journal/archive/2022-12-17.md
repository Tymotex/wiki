# Thoughts
I had an okay day today but I got distracted a few times by youtube, reddit and ChatGPT. I'm at least slowly getting back into the swing of things.

# What is an accomplishment you're very proud of? Why are you proud of it? What can you do to do more things like that?
I am very proud of having asked out Joanna and actually seemingly having her be attracted to me. I was proud of it because I thought of her as being too good for me, but I learned she is just a regular person as well but who tends towards extremes in certain things. In the future, I won't be so afraid of girls and thinking myself unworthy of them.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
Ryan Holiday for writing his inspiring books.
