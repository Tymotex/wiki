# Thoughts
I struggled so much with focusing on the right things today. I really needed to get that monitoring task done, but I didn't. I had time, I had focus, but I simply chose not to. I chose not to swallow the frog. That disappoints me. I can be doing so much more and doing things to a much higher standard if only I would just say fuck it and do the thing I least wanted to do but knew would benefit me greatly to have done.

This is resistance I suppose. I should really read the War of Art.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
Smart and hard-working co-workers. I want to be like them.
