# Thoughts
I feel a pretty strong urge to game again. I don't know if I should. I find Rimworld really enjoyable, and the new expansion has me longing to play it, but I know that it's not good for me. I honestly think I'll just pass. Maybe at some point I'll play again, but right now is a dangerous time to be picking up bad habits again. I can't let my bad habits exceed just PMO.

I spent the better part of this morning (my most impactful hours) writing notes on Spark. I don't think it's wasted time, but I could have been doing something more meaningful. I think that in the morning I felt that I had too many tasks and was a bit overwhelmed, so I decided to do the thing with the least resistance, and that was finishing off Spark notes. In the future, I should avoid having such huge task lists... I don't know what to do about it yet, but maybe I'll more ruthlessly drop things.
