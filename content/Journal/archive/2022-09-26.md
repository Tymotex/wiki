**Am I happy with today?**
No. I am so disappointed in myself for relapsing to porn. I got bad sleep and just couldn't control myself. Actually, no, I got triggered by a few things and couldn't control myself after that.

**What can I do better?**
Implement a better system for avoiding and preventing relapses.

**What am I grateful for?**
That I'm guilty whenever these relapses happen.
