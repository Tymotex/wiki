title: Monthly Review
---

The point of weekly reviews is mainly to ensure that the projects are keeping to deadlines. The point of monthly reviews it to check that the projects are worth doing and that I'm progressing to the right goals the right way.

- [x] Review [[Tasks/Goals|Goals]].
    - [x] Are you happy with them?
    - [x] Are you on track to completing them?
        - I just need to get Konflux done ASAP and move on to the math website. Then I'm pretty on track, career-wise. With investing, I've just got to push through with real estate vs. stocks. Lifting I'm fine. Reading I'm doing pretty well too. I think I could have more career goals.
- [x] What are the 3 highest priority projects over next month?
    - Probably: Konflux, math website, structs.sh. Also, building a second brain whenever I've got a moment where I want to do some fun coding.
- [x] What other projects should you bring to life or put in the ice box?
    - None. They're all important right now.
