**Am I happy with today?**


**What can I do better?**


**What am I grateful for?**
I'm grateful that I'm a happy person. I'm grateful that I'm bulletproof against depression. I'm grateful to know that whatever happens to me or my loved ones, I will always find meaning in my life and in suffering.
