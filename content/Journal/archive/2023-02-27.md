# Thoughts
Today I spent the evening doing yoga at Google and chatting with Anna and Therese. I find it really nice to form freindships with them. I feel like I'm rekindling the feeling of having people regularly around me like in high school. I feel like I'm redeeming myself for never having the courage or motivation to have actively sought friends in university. I think they're impressive and great people to have around you. I like that I'll be the average of them (but I hope to better).

I also found out through them that Ryan doesn't listen to music while he runs. I suspect he's also a David Goggins fane. I should learn to do the same.

Today, my parents caught that cute lop bunny that was roaming around my street for the last several weeks. It's adorable. I'm glad that it made my mum and dad happier while it was there.
