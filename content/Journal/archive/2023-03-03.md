# Thoughts
I feel that as a man, I should be getting girls. I shouldn't keep pushing it back. This would be a source of growth for me. I am actually afraid of it. I deserve to be humbled by it.

It's an interesting position to be in - I just started work and met so many new people and they all know me differently than people who knew me in university and especially people who knew in me in high school. My coworkers know me as someone who seems 'measured' in their life. Disciplined. That's the sort of person I really am right now. I told people I run everyday and even meditate everyday. I don't have a perfect grip on the routines in my life, but I'd better at least run and meditate everyday. These are things that are part of your identity. My coworkers also recognise me as someone who is physically strong. This is probably the biggest shift for me. I've never been considered strong before. I absolutely should seek to continue my pursuit of lifting.

I did Jiu Jitsu yesterday and it felt pretty incredible.
