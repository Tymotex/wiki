# Thoughts
I had so many times today where I just felt so horny. I keep thinking about cunnilingus. It's so unbelievably hot to me, the idea of pleasuring a woman so deeply. I promise myself not to masturbate until the day I ask out Jenny. If I get a yes, then I'll continue to hold it in, otherwise I'll feel less of a man.
