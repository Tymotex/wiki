# Thoughts
I masturbated again a few times recently. I just feel empty inside. I'm so glad that I have resisted porn usage so far, but I've come close to relapsing hard. I'm going to keep trying. Next time I get an urge, I'll just watch it and let it pass. I notice that when I dwell on an initial urge, it becomes incredibly potent. I notice that when I catch a glimpse of something provocative on YouTube or elsewhere online, I feel  an urge. I can solve these problems by simply being indifferent to the urge and avoiding YouTube.
