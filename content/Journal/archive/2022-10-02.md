# Thoughts
Not really that proud of today. I spent most of it on konflux,then origami. I was super inefficient towards the end of the day. I need to just focus solely on one thing and ruthlessly do it for the entire day.

# Think of a thing, item, or product you’ve been wanting to replace or upgrade. Is what you currently have functioning well enough? What do you appreciate about it? What sustained value will an upgrade or replacement add to your life?
I've been wanting to upgrade my watch. Yes it is good enough. I remember scratching it and feeling pretty bad about it, thinking I'd need to replace it, but now I barely notice it. In fact, I probably appreciate it more now that I realised it's not invincible. And upgrade would do close to nothing for me in the best case.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
I'm really grateful for having my own home gym. I also grateful for my hobbies and that I find so many different things really interesting.
