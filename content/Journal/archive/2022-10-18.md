# Thoughts
It was very interesting to observe my frustration at mum anytime she sat my side and incessantly questioned what I was doing when booking a flight ticket for my aunt. I don't know why, but her lack of patience was really frustrating. I also wish my family would respect my lifestyle ideals a bit more, I really do not want to be distracted in the morning, or have to be called for lunch immediately every time. I'm grateful for the things they provide and especially their unconditional love and support but sometimes I do get frustrated.

# What go-to coping strategies help you get through moments of emotional or physical pain?
Talking to mum. Watching motivational self-help videos... Watching relaxing videos of stocism, existentialism, etc. to remind me of my cosmic insignificance. Why the hell am I worrying about something so trivial? 

# One Thing You're Grateful For
That I have an aunt, and that she's coming over. Seriously, how many times am I going to see her again? The sad thing is that this could be the last time. You never know what'll happen in life, and life tends to be tragic when things have been going good for a long time.
