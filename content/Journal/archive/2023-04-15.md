# Thoughts
Today was not a great day. I woke up very late (close to 9am) because I had absolute garbage sleep. I was in bed for pretty much 12 hours and got barely 8 hours sleep.

I loved spending time with my parents and brother today at Marrickville. We ate pho and I was a degenerate and ate more chilli than I could handle.
