**Am I happy with today?**
I'm feeling okay about today. Subjectively, it doesn't feel like I accomplished all that much, however when I see what I've checked for today, it's an okay amount. 

I slept so much better last night. I think it was because I didn't look at screens much and because I got in bed before 9. I'll continue to do that. I'm pretty happy that my Fitbit sleep scores are consistently higher than they were nearer the start of the year.

I love Man's Search for Meaning. It's a book that really gets me to think deeply about meaning and suffering and stoicism.

**What can I do better?**
Next, like I mentioned already, I need to just pick the most challenging and most meaningful project and dive in head-first in the 4 hours morning deep work block that I have each day. Today, I spent a lot of that time just reading about personal finance, which wasn't wasted time, but I could have spent it coding something challenging.

**What am I grateful for?**
Having a mum that can see when I am feeling under the weather and will do her best to console me and lift my mood. Having a dad who is seriously optimistic and reassures me that everything will be fine.
