# Thoughts
I masturbated without porn today. I definitely don't feel as shameful about doing it, but I still feel drained and lethargic and hollow. It's still better to not ejaculate.
I really need to focus on sleeping better.

# Was today a meaningful day? Are you any closer to your goals?
Somewhat. I am simply maintaining my goals right now. 

# One Thing You're Grateful For
Google.
