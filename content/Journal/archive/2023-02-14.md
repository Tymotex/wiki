# Thoughts
Today's Valentine's day. I can't help but feel a bit sad. I want to love someone and to make someone happy. This might be the last Valentines day of my life as a single person.

I really want to strive for 'perfection'. I want to be smart, smashing my career, reading loads of books, lifting lots of weight, being better with people. I remember in Sims 3 there was the lifetime wish "Perfect Mind, Perfect Body". I'd love for that to be me. I want to be the most attractive all-rounder I can be. I want to be capable of being loved by someone.

Now that I've stopped gaming, I realise that there is so much more to life that I could have been doing. I regret all that time I spent mostly idle and playing games. I should have been lifting weights, reading or playing guitar.

# Is your mind being held hostage by someone else’s exciting life, better skills, or bigger accomplishments? Why should you be happy for them and why should you not compare myself to them?
Yes. I think of people like Jenny. She's probably smarter, harder working, better looking, more socially prolific than me. I should be happy for her instead. She's got sick family in China, her dad is probably not very present in her life. I don't know about her problems, but she for sure has a number of them. She's had her advantages in life, there's no point comparing.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
Being single. I get this time to be selfish.
