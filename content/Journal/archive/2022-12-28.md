# Thoughts
I have never had such bad sleep for the last several years. I'm glad that I experienced this, it feels like catharsis.

I am worthless. I am a wretch. The only path forward is to start being a good man or die trying. I still don't know precisely what that means.

You don't work hard enough. You don't push yourself hard enough. You never do the uncomfortable thing. Why not?

Nothing is stopping you from learning ruthlessly and working hard. No one is stopping you from excelling in your work and becoming among the best in the industry. No one but you.

# What does your work teach you? Does it offer continued opportunities for learning and growth?

# One Thing You're Grateful For
