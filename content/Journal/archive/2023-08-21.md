# Thoughts
I still feel really disappointed and sad at the idea that my partner has had casua sex in the past. I feel that way because I dislike the idea that she could see intimacy in that way. Something to be freely engaged in, with people she doesn't necessarily trust or love. I feel that it cheapens my intimacy with her, and that it won't be seen as a great act of my my commitment to her. This is irrational. I've thought about and have greatly desired sex, and probably would have caved into having casual sex if it was easily accessible. I suppose that makes me hypocritical.

I can't stand the idea of feeling like I'm getting someon'e s leftovers. It disgusts me a bit. That someone had sex with my partner without having feelings for them, that they weren't good enough for them, but that they are good enough for me? I hate the idea that they were 'used', and that my partner allowed such a thing to happen. I suppose this is something I need to talk to my partner about. I just hope to do it in a way that doesn't shame heror make me seem insecure.  I'm just disappointed, both in this act and in my irrational thoughts about it.
