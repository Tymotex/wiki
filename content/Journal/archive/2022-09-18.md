**Am I happy with today?**
Mildly satisfied. I spent the morning setting up mobile Git sync and then doing some C++ problems. I had a walk with my family at Meadowbank again which just seems to suck up a quarter of the day. I wrapped up a few more things about the Cairns trip, so I think I'm pretty much done with that.

**What can I do better?**
I need to just dive in, head first, into the thing I am feeling a lot of resistance to but which I really want to move forward on.

**What am I grateful for?**
I'm grateful that my mum wants me to be happy and actively tries to make me so. I'm also grateful that my parents are grateful towards me.
