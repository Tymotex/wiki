# Thoughts
Not a bad day, I worked an average amount of time today, but I could always do a lot better (I estimate today I did around 5-6 hours, excluding reading). I should be pushing hard to do 8 hours of solid work, at least 3 of which should involve deep focus. I lost the morning today — I went out with my parents to Chatswood again to eat fried bread sticks.

# Think of a thing, item, or product you’ve been wanting to replace or upgrade. Is what you currently have functioning well enough? What do you appreciate about it? What sustained value will an upgrade or replacement add to your life?
I've been wanting to update my barbell and rack. In truth, the current setup is fine, it just lacks safety features and is a bit rusted. After searching this up a bit, I think it should be fine. I love that my barbell, rack and bench have led to me forming an amazing hobby. If it weren't for my brother, I wouldn't have had this, and I'd probably be a lot worse off because of that. An upgrade would feel marginally better, but I'm better off using the money for something else I think.
