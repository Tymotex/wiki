# Thoughts
Today was okay but where di the time go? I see how easy it is for me to be derailed. I watched a few clips of Game of Thrones after my run in the morning today and suddenly it was 8:30am, and I didn't end up meditating. In the future, I should treat my routines as sacred.

I care about my looks. I need to get them as good as possible. I'm going to spend the entirety of next year just getting into amazing shape and improving my health. This is why I joined Google instead of Citadel. I will spend all this time bettering myself, having an amazing life outside of work.

# Do you see yourself in the same job in 10 years?
Same industry for sure. I hope to be a techlead after a decade or less.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
Learning to meditate *properly*.
