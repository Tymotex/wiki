# Thoughts
I will stop taking food back from Google. It's not really ethical. I was bringing them back for my mum, but it's not right.

Today was okay, I learned quite a lot from attempting the migration. I get a bit of brainfog in the afternoon and find it hard to start new tasks.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
My brother for all the mentorship he gave me throughout my life. Also grateful for my time with parents, while I still have them around me.
