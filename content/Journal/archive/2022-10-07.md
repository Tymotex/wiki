# Thoughts
I got a fitbit sleep score of 87 and feel pretty amazing this morning. The sun is partially out as well. I was in bed for more than 9 hours however, and I had a total time asleep of around 8 hours 13 mins. In the future, I should wind down outside of bed and just enter it to sleep. Also, I had to wake up to go to the toilet. I think these are the two big things I need to improve on: wind down separately outside of bed, and stop drinking water a few hours shy of bedtime.

Damn, I really need to just get sleep right and my life will improve so much.

I did a decent amount of work today. I just really want to wrap up Konflux this week, I've already exceeded my previous deadline which was Sunday 2nd Oct, which in retrospect was way too ambitious. I'm starting let some broken windows stick around in the codebase now which I hate, but I just want to get this shipped and out of the way. Also, I really wish I had tracked my progress a little better :(. Never too late to do it.

# Think of someone you admire. Write yourself advice you think they would give you from their point-of-view.
The first person to come to mind is David Goggins. He would tell me to suffer more, and that I'm way too comfortable, and he'd be right. I've been avoiding doing things that scare me for too long.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
Having a good night's sleep.
