# Thoughts
I'm so frustrated with today. I basically went out from 7am to 6pm today, so I virtually had no time to work. I hope to not repeat this kind of day in the future, even if it means less time with family. I just feel awful in the car. I could have quality time with them without spending the entire day trapped in a car.

# Does your work drain or overwhelm you? Why? Is this something you can change?
No, but sometimes my approach to work does. I'm not so sure how to improve. I should perhaps focus on doing the most impactful things I can think of, rather than just doing the things I'm most comfortable with.
