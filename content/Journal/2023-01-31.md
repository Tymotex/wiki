# Thoughts
I got such terrible sleep last night. It made me so much less productive and so much less social.

I invited Arthur and Waleed today. I honestly felt a bit sad about missing out on HFT.

I feel ashamed for not sitting closer to Jenny. I feel ashamed for not taking the lead more when showing my friends around. I feel ashamed for not speaking more. I don't know what's wrong with me.

I'm not going to care what Jenny thinks of me. I'll just carry on as I am.
