# Thoughts
I just want to log what's stressing me:
- Work.
	- I really worry about disappointing others.
	- This week I'm going to kill it:
		- I'll finish all the docs (proposal, investigation/design, estimation).
		- I'll get the config only node up and running.
		- I'll finish that fucking alerting change.
		- And then that's it. A lot less work stress.
- Health.
	- My sleep is giving me a great deal of stress. I think it's generally related to me not being able to wind down properly and thinking about all the things worrying me. This is why I really need an evening routine.
	- I want my cardio and strength to be better, although this is less
	- I don't like that my right nostril is constantly still blocked. I should be seeing a specialist, or perhaps a GP first.
- Family.
	- Nothing particularly stressful. Just have some chores to do like citizenship application. Etc.
	- I am a bit stressed about my parents' health and happiness.
- Relationships:
	- Nothing is really stressing me about this anymore. I think I've passed the point of greatest stress and now we can fall into something like a stable state.
	- I want to be able to have sex. I need a plan.

I feel that my life is not under my control at the moment.
