# Thoughts
I had a deep conversation with my mum about travel and happiness. 

There's always going to be new problems that arise. There'll never be a perfect time when the finances are in order, where we all have our health and wellbeing, where our relationships are all perfect. There is only going to be problem after problem. It's a tragedy to give up this opportunity to be happy, us 3, and travel a few times. This is what we live for. This is the point of the money that we make. Why else do we care to be wealthy? For health and security, absolutely, but we live in a great nation where we pretty much have those even if we're completely bankrupt. What other reasons are there to cling onto all this wealth and worry about finances? Our basic needs are taken care of with very little money. All the excess should go into what endeavour will bring us the greatest joy. As far as I know, that should be travel.

I want mum and dad to go and see the world. See the world before their health degrades. They'll seriously regret it
