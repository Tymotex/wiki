# Thoughts
I wish I just bit the bullet and started workign on Konflux and my other important goals. I'll do that tomorrow.

Also, when am I going to stop masturbating? I've never felt good from doing it. I think this sexual energy really matters to my wellbeing. I can't keep draining myself of that. I need to just start again. I'll be back on it in 2 weeks.
