**Am I happy with today?**
I'm feeling angry towards dad for complaining so much while going outdoors with mum and I. I wish he would stop using his phone so much while outside with us and that he would just enjoy the experience more. I am honestly so pissed off towards him and do not want to go out with him anymore.

**What can I do better?**
I need to work harder and be more willing to endure severe discomfort for the sake of my goals. I am pretty goal-less right now and that's dangerous. Things will expand to take up all this precious time that I have available at the moment and I won't have this much time again.

**What am I grateful for?**
I'm grateful that I have a great job lined up. I remember being so damn happy to have gotten that internship.
