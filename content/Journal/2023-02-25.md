# Thoughts
I went to hang out with a couple of Google grads today. Man, Ryan is such an amazing dude. He seems to just have it all: he's got good looks, he's tall, he's smart and has a great career, he's personable. I like that a guy like him is around me. It'll pull me up. 

Then there are people like Arthur. You're lucky to know and have these people around you. You've got something high to shoot for. You're going to outwork both these people and achieve greater heights than them. It starts with working harder behind the scenes than them. You already know how hard both of them work, kind of. You just need to work harder across all dimensions. You've got to work out hard, you've got to study and work hard.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
Ryan. He'll be a great friend I hope, and a great rival.
