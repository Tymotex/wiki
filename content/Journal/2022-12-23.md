# Thoughts
I notice that I procrastinate largely because "I'm not in the right mindset for the task". E.g. If I really want to get some programming done but my mind is constantly thinking about investing, I somehow justify continuing with learning investing because that's the most efficient way of task allocation (to minimise context switching since my mind was already on the topic of investing). This is really just an excuse to be a little bitch. I'm not having it in the future. I do know that context switching is in fact a problem, but I am definitely not better off using this 'efficient task allocation' decision-making to then never actually complete the tasks I really wanted to complete. Putting it off only made it harder. In the past, I had no problem with whipping out VSCode and just coding, but now I do.
