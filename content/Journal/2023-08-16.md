## Thoughts
I spent the night over at her place. I'd love to be productive with her. I feel a bit uneasy about how much I like her. It feels like an all-too-familiar trajectory.

What is worrying me?
- I want to finish my work:
	- Wiki contributions.
	- Config node.
	- Deployment layout doc.
	- Alerting.
- I want to get through my reading:
	- DDIA.
	- Breath.
	- BHoT.

That's about it. I just feel a general feeling that I don't have a grip on my life.

What else is on my mind... I wish I had better health. That I could sleep better, in particular.
