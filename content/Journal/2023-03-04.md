# Thoughts
I masturbated twice yesterday. I was so groggy the whole day. I think I slept poorly and was a bit overwhelmed by work which led me to being weak. I felt pretty terrible having done that. I already know that I am never better off for masturbating despite all the promising feelings that I would be. If I just don't use my phone, there is pretty much no risk to me being a degenerate and thinking about porn consumption. I'm thankful that I at least had the strength to resist porn usage. I've gotten through the first two months without it now, and intend to go the full way through.
