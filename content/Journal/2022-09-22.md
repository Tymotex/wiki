**Am I happy with today?**
It was kinda okay today. I worked a decent amount of hours however I am a bit disappointed with my output quality and quantity. I should focus on one hard task in the morning.

**What can I do better?**
Seriously, just get one hard task done in the morning. Spend the rest learning and reading, knowing you've already done something hard and important upfront.

**What am I grateful for?**
Mum for advocating to take the trip to Cairns. I think it really will be one of the best experiences in our lifetime.
