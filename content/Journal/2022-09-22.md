**Am I happy with today?**
It was okay today. I worked a decent amount of hours however I am a bit disappointed with my output quality and quantity. I should focus on one hard task in the morning.

I am so disappointed with myself. Where the hell does my time go each day? Why does it not amount to much? I've had months to myself at this point and what do I have to show for it? What even are my goals at this point? I just have a backlog of things to accomplish or try but that's it. How can I get out of this rut and work hard and feel something again?

I feel so guilty that I haven't been able to get my parents to a better state in life. They should be healthier and wealthier and happier, and I could have done more to help them.

**What can I do better?**
Seriously, just get one hard task done in the morning. Spend the rest learning and reading, knowing you've already done something hard and important upfront.

**What am I grateful for?**
Mum for advocating to take the trip to Cairns. I think it really will be one of the best experiences in our lifetime.
