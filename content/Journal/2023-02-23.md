# Thoughts
I don't know why I was so weak-minded today. I masturbated twice, and was really tempted to go and install Skyrim and get all the sex mods for it. My god. I'm thankful that I didn't succumb to porn, so at least I'm not that much of a loser. I felt the urge to also game again, I was looking at Morrowind and Divinity and Baldur's Gate wikis. I don't think I'm going to game at all, at least until August. I'm definitely not going to watch porn again. Fuck that. The next time I see a girl naked will either be for real or unintentionally.
