# Thoughts
I had such awful fucking sleep these past two nights, mostly because I'm thinking about her. I've experienced this before, and it's got to stop.

I'm just going journal here to get it out of my system. I keep fantasising about being intimate with her -- cuddling her, holding her hands, kissing, having passionate sex, giving her orgasms. I can't get this out of my mind. I masturbated and this helped a bit to take off the sexual frustration.

You're going to volunteer with her next Friday/Saturday. She's interested in you, the hard part is already taken care of. All you have to do is detach, and focus on yourself. This is the surest way to maintain her attraction in you. You're doing yourself no favours by constantly thinking of her

TODO: meditation.
