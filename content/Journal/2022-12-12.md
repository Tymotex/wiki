> \"Hurry up and live.\" — Seneca

# Thoughts
Where did all my time go? I spent it all reading, cooking, cleaning and exercising. Then it was all gone. This is why I need structure rather than spontaneity in my life.

# Think of 12 year-old you. What “secrets of life” have you acquired that you would want to share with yourself?
Work hard. It's what makes you happiest.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
My dad.
