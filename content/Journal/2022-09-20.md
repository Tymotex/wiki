**Am I happy with today?**
A bit more than usual. I sat down and learned more about Python (this time about built-in modules). I finished a script to format my Obsidian tasks and it actually worked. I also unit tested things a decent amount. It felt good because I actually think I wrote a readable, extensible, tested script. It's got a number of flaws for sure, but this little project made me feel like a craftsman.

**What can I do better?**
I relapsed today. I should have prevented it. I kept rationalising, as usual.

**What am I grateful for?**
A mum and dad that will work hard together to make life better.
