# Thoughts
I have a lot to journal about but today is a bit late. I had a decent workday today, mainly because I learned a lot and worked on some interesting problems. I didn't have problems with drowsiness because I was seriously engaged in what I was doing for a while. One problem I noticed was that I really did not want to switch context, it was challenging to think of anything other than the migration.

I'm getting sexual urges quite a lot again, but learning to decouple them from urges to masturbate. The sexual urges do feel quite empowering. It's like an inner force within me, driving me to get the fuck out there and take meaningful risks.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
My team at Google for being accepting of me, despite being a slow learner.
