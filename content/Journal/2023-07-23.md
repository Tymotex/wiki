# Thoughts
I was anxious about Mercury the entirety of today. It felt like we were delaying something inevitable. After speaking to her in a heartfelt and authentic way, I feel optimistic that we have a good shot at a great relationship. It's just a shame there are so many complications.

I kissed her, then I escalated sexually by pinning her down, kissing her neck, taking off her clothes, licking her down there. I had masturbated twice that day out of sexual frustration, so I didn't have too much vigor, but still I was so turned on. When she took off my clothes, I started feeling anxiety about commitment.

I don't really want to write much more. It was an exhausting, overly emotional day. I didn't get great sleep.

I just don't want this relationship to change too much about me. I still see other things as the purpose of my life, and a partner is a great way to support that purpose. I want to rise to the high standards I set myself to because I know that her eyes may be on me.
