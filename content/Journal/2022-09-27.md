**Am I happy with today?**
It was average. I didn't code today unfortunately. Holy crap I spend so much time just eating... it is actually frustratingly bad. I think I probably spend 2 hours just eating, everyday. I also get annoyed having to talk to Raymond... I think I should really try not to meet up with him as much and just slowly distance myself. I'm not really interested in being like him.

I finished Rich Dad Poor Dad today. It was a decent book but not groundbreaking. It was helpful in confirming a lot about what I already knew vaguely or concretely from reading various things online and from reading other books on personal finance and entrepreneurship.

**What can I do better?**
I need deadlines. I need them badly, else I will always be frustrated at how little I accomplish.

**What am I grateful for?**
