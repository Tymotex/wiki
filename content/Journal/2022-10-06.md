# Thoughts
I found out that that girl probably doesn't care at all about me. I had some pretty inflated ideas that I was her idol, but it turns out it was just her mum who idolised me. I need to get out of my own head. I'm not that good at all. I have to be better for these girls to actually be head over heels for me. Plus, she really isn't that high quality of a partner, probably, given how little social awareness she seemed to have during that dinner. Good, you dodged a bullet. You really have to refine your tastes and especially your standards. You should ignore all women for at least the next several years.

# Think of something you‘ve done that you regret. Write yourself an apology and your own response of forgiveness.
I really regret not reading. I'm sorry that I couldn't execute on the little bit of discipline required to get into a reading habit. You would have benefited so much from this, but I failed you. It's okay though because I'm reading now and forgive my past self for being so selfish and inconsiderate of my future self.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
I'm grateful to all the books that have taught me so much and about so many lessons I would have had to painfully and unnecessarily make.
