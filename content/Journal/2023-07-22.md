# Thoughts
I had a date with Mercury today. I met her at 12:30pm and spent pretty much 12 hours with her. We went to the Royal Botanic Garden to walk around and talk on the park benches. We went on a ferry ride to Darling Harbour. We had dinner at Nakano Darling. I cried after she told me about her illness. It reminded me about my mum and made me realise how much suffering they both had to endure. We went to Meetfresh and shared strawberry bingsu, then left to walk along the Darling Harbour bridge. We looked out over the bridge and it happened that they were setting off fireworks that day at 8:30pm.

Then suddenly the date became depressing, after she revealed that she was strongly opposed to having children. We had shared special moments together, then it dawned on us that we may not continue. I was holding back tears. After some deliberation in the freezing cold, we headed back home. Holy fuck was it cold, both of us were on survival mode to make it to the bus stop back home. It was pretty fun. Then we stopped in The Star to warm up, and that's when she told me how she went about clarifying her feelings for me. I was really moved. We then went home together, and I got terrible sleep thinking about her.
