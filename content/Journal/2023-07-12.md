# Thoughts
I had a really memorable day today. Bittersweet. Mercury asked to catch the bus with me in the morning and we did. We chatted casually about things and it was pleasant, but she met with me because she wanted to ask me about whether I'd been hearing distasteful rumours about her from the other grads in our cohort. I sat with her for around an hour or so, letting her open up to me about how distressing it was. It was awful to hear but I'm glad to feel closer to her.

I had humorous conversations with her throughout the day. I hope I took some of the unpleasantness away. We went back home together on the bus as well, and we had heartfelt conversation. I opened up about my family's wellbeing and how it drives me every day to be a strong man who's committed to living well and helping them live well. I gave her my favourite book, Meditations. I'll look back on this day fondly.
