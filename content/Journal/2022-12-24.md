# Thoughts
I am so frustrated with how I slept last night. I don't remember being so fucking pissed off about it. This isn't normal. I should journal about what's occupying my mind prior to sleep. I should spend as long as needed for that. I need to also wind down properly, rather than trying to compensate for all the work I didn't do over the day. I'm so irritated right now, and I haven't felt this way in a long time.

I'm even more disappointed in Simon now. That's what's occupied my mind. I am going to distance myself from him. He's destructive and irrational.

I fucking hate how weak I am. When am I going to grow the fuck up? You're a pathetic thing.
