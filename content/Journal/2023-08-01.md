# Thoughts
Today was a decent day. It finally dawned on me how much time I’ve been wasting, how unproductive I have been, how much potential I never realised this year. I am kicking into gear and doing stuff now.

WHat’s on my mind:

- Definitely a bit stressed about work. THe things worrying me are: the alerting stuff. The presentation. THe oncall stuff, the ST-CP handoff, the docs. I think these are all fine. THe alerting stuff gives me the most stress. ONce that’s done, I swear I’ll be good.
- Nothing else is really giving me stress. I think I sorted ut all those Notion tasks I really wanted to get done. Now things are starting to get back under control for me.
- Nothing else I’m stressed about. I am looking forward to seeing JIaru.
