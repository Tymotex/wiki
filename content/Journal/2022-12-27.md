> \"It is difficulties that show what men are.\" â€” Epictetus

# Thoughts
TOday was an unproductive day unfortunately. My mum's friend's family came over for a long lunch. It was quite draining. I thought that girl was really attractive, but not really well socialised, in that she didn't seem very polite or able to show interest in other people. 

I am reading Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. It feels like a new chapter has opened up in my life. I want to ask of myself what Marcus Aurelius would do, in any difficult situation I find myself in. I want to think thta I have some piece of his introspective awareness with me at each moment. I want to live no longer blind to my helplessly falling into patterns of behaviour that are uncharacteristic of me. I want to master my mind and no longer be puppeteered by emotion, by aversion to pain and towards hedonism.

# What do you most want to accomplish in life?
To be a good man, whatever that means.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
Marcus Aurelius' thoughts having survived 2 millenia to find itself inside my Kobo Libra 2. With the help of these great thinkers, I'll become a good man.
