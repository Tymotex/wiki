> \"Give yourself a gift, the present moment.\" — Marcus Aurelius

# Thoughts
I had a moment of weakness and masturbated. I was getting up from a nap. This seems to have happened many times in the past. I need to avoid that post-nap weakness. The clarity hits instantly. The conclusion is always the same — it's not worth it. Here are a few things that contributed to the failure:
- It's the 30th of December. "I'll do it one last time this year."
- Diogenes still masturbated. Lmao.
- I woke up groggy from the nap. I was a bit sleep deprived overall today.
- I didn't leave my room to clear my head.
- I need to focus later on and willpower is limited (this is probably the most common one I fallback to).
- I didn't think about what Marcus Aurelius would do.

This is honestly a big problem in my life. I think I'll go pornfree next year.

Good. I know that this is harer than I thought, and I already knew it was hard. Now I will know to treat this seriously as it deserves.

I get frustrated easily about time spent on things not work, but ironically, I delay work anyway. Meaningful work at least. I'm such an imperfect person.

# Was today a meaningful day? Are you any closer to your goals?
A little. I finally dived back into SRE.

# One Thing You're Grateful For
My mum's liking of our pet angelfish. I really hope I can take care of them properly and keep them alive and healthy for as long as I can.
