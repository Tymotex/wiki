# Thoughts

TODO: why was I not as productive as I liked to be today? Why exactly? What can I do to improve?

TODO: think of all the times you've lied. How different could the world have been otherwise? How would you tactfully told the truth?

TODO: amend your principles to never lie.

# What are three self-defeating thoughts that show up in your self-talk? How can you reframe them to encourage yourself instead?

# One Thing You're Grateful For
