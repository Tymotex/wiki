### Unemployment

Unemployment is categorised into 3 groups:

1. **Frictional** — unemployment as a result of transitioning between different jobs (or from full-time university). In a given time period, unemployed people can become employed and employed people can become unemployed.
    
    Change in level of unemployment is given by: $\Delta U = sL - fU$, where:
    
    - $s$ is the job separation rate
    - $L$ is the number of employed people
    - $f$ is the job finding rate
    - $U$ is the number of unemployed people.
    
    The long-run frictional unemployment is given by: $u = \frac{s}{s+f} \times 100$, derived by combining $\Delta U = sL - fU$ with $\text{labour force}=L+U$.
    
2. **Structural** — unemployment as a result of a changing economy. Some industries will shrink as a result of change in demand and therefore people will lose their jobs.
    - Policies that address structural unemployment involve re-training programs for assisting the transition of workers to different industries.
3. **Cyclical** — temporary unemployment as a result of changes over the ***business cycle***. Cyclical unemployment rate is strongly correlated with recessions. 
    - Cyclical unemployment can become classified as structural unemployment when the skills of a cyclically unemployed person go out of demand after the cyclical downturn.
    - The **Natural rate of unemployment**, given by: $u^* = \text{frict. unemployment + struct. unemployment}$, represents the unemployment rate that’s independent of fluctuations in real GDP.
    - The cyclical unemployment rate is the difference between total unemployment $u$ and natural unemployment $u^*$, which is: $\text{Cyclical unemployment rate }= u - u^*$.

### Okun’s Law

Okun’s law is an empirical result that states how a country’s *cyclical unemployment* rate changes when the **output gap** changes. 

Note: a negative cyclical unemployment rate means that workers who *were* frictionally or structurally unemployed are pulled into jobs.

$$
\underbrace{\frac{Y-Y^*}{Y^*}\times 100}_{\text{Output gap (percentage)}}  = - \beta \underbrace{(u - u^*)}_{\text{Cycl. unempl. rate}}
$$

This relationship states that the **output gap** is directly proportional to the negative of the **cyclical unemployment rate**. In Australia, the $\beta$ coefficient is estimated to be somewhere around 2, which means that with a 1% rise in cyclical unemployment rate we’ll expect a 2% drop in output gap. We determine $\beta$  empirically through statistics.

- **Utilisation rate**: the rate at which a business uses their factors of production: labour and capital. Businesses have granular control over whether they have high or low utilisation (eg. working more or fewer hours), however there is a *normal utilisation rate* that is economically sustainable in the long-term. If ***all*** businesses operate at such utilisation rate, then we achieve the value of the **potential real GDP**, $Y^*$, or also known as the **potential output**. It’s hard to measure/estimate potential GDP.
- **Output gap**: the difference between the real GDP $Y$ and the *potential GDP $Y^*$*: $\text{Output gap} = Y - Y^*$, or expressed as a percentage, $\frac{Y-Y^*}{Y^*}\times 100$.
    - When the output gap is negative, we call it a *contractionary gap*. Likewise, we call it an *expansionary gap* when the output gap is positive.
    - Persistent contractionary gaps imply an underutilisation of labour & capital and that we’re not producing as much as we could.
    - Persistent expansionary gaps imply an overutilisation of labour & capital. It typically drives inflation to higher rates since prices of goods increase in response to higher demand.

### Labour Supply & Demand

**Marginal product of labour**, $MPL$ — the additional output produced when you supply an extra 1 unit of labour (with all other factors of production held constant).

- $VMPL$ — the monetary value of the additional output produced for each extra unit of labour, ie. $p\times MPL$, where $p$ is the price per unit of output. This represents the labour demand curve.
    - Improvements to worker productivity (eg. more capital goods or better technology) will shift the labour demand curve to the right.
    - **Diminishing marginal product**. The ability of each additional worker to help us diminishes. Each new worker produces less than the previous. It’s a valid assumption when you’re holding capital fixed.
    - The optimal amount for a firm is when $\text{marginal benefit}=\text{marginal cost}$, ie. when $VMPL$ gained for an additional work is greater than or equal to the cost of hiring that extra worker.
- **Real wage**, $\frac{W}{P}$— the nominal wage divided by some measure of the price of goods & services (eg. CPI).




**Labour market:**

Shifts in the aggregate labour supply curve can happen due to immigration, birth rate changes, retirement age changes, and any number of other things that influence the general willingness for the population to participate in the labour market.

At equilibrium, everyone who is willing to work for the market real wage *will* be employed.

Factors such as minimum wage laws, labour unions, taxes keep us away from market equilibrium real wage.

A higher minimum wage will increase unemployment rates, *theoretically*.

Here, $L^s-L^d$ is the number of people who *would be willing* to work but cannot find employment.

Adding taxes on labour will pull the labour supply curve left since fewer people will be willing to work for a lower net wage.
