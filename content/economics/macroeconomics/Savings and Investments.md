Disposable income

$\text{YD} = Y - \text{taxes}+\text{government transfers} + \text{government interest payments} - \text{business retained earnings}$.

## Investment

An **investment** is the act of purchasing new goods as capital, ie. as input to bolster future production.

- **Private investment** — any investment made by households/businesses. Eg. buying equipment, software, computers, buildings (new dwelling), etc.
- **Public investment** — any investment made by the government.
- **Inventory investment** — the change in *inventory* in an economy.

**Capital stock** — “everything in an economy that enables businesses to generate future sales,” eg. buildings, bridges, literally everything.

- Formula for the **accumulation of capital stock**: $K_1 = I_1 + \underbrace{ K_0(1-\delta)}_{\text{Depreciation}}$, ie. the stock at the end of a period is equal to the stock at the start of the period, plus investments over that period, minus the depreciation of the stock at the start.
    - Typically, capital goods are *durable* and can continue to be consumed or sold after some use.

The decision of whether a business purchases capital goods (ie. invests) follows a familiar marginal cost-benefit analysis. 

- Marginal benefit: **value of the marginal product of capital**, $VMPK = MPK\times \text{price per unit}$ — value of the marginal product of capital ($MPK$).
- Marginal cost: **user cost of capital**, $UC = P_K + \underbrace{iP_K}_{\text{Interest}}-\underbrace{(1 - \delta)}_{\text{Dep.}} \times\underbrace{(P_K+\Delta P_K)}_{\text{End-of-year market price}}$ — the cost for getting the good for 1 year, for example. Note that we can resell the capital good since it’s *durable*.
    - A simpler approximation is given as $UC\approx P_K\big( i + \delta - \frac{\Delta P_K}{P_K} \big)$.
    - An even further simplification is assuming that changes in the market price $\frac{\Delta P_K}{P_K}$ is equal to inflation $\pi$, giving $UC\approx P_K(r+\delta)$, where $r = i - \pi$.

ℹ️ We will only invest in a capital good if the **value of marginal product of capital** (margin benefit) equals the **user cost of capital** (marginal cost), ie. when 
$VMPK=UC$.

### Savings (in Closed Economies)

A **saving** is the difference between income and consumption.

-   **Household savings** — $\text{gross household saving} = \text{disposable income }- \text{ consumption expenditure}$, where:
    -   Disposable income can be broken down as: $YD = \underbrace{Y}_{\text{GDP}}-\underbrace{\text{taxes}}_{\text{Direct \& indirect}}+\text{gov. transfers}+\text{gov. interest payments}-\text{business retained earnings}$.
        -   Government transfer payments is the money you receive from the government directly ‘for free’ (eg. youth allowance).
        -   Government interest payments is the interest the government pays you for holding _government bonds_.
        -   Business retained earnings is the profit that a business won’t pay as dividends to shareholders.
    -   Net worth
    -   Accumulation of wealth: $W_1 = W_0 + \text{household savings} + \text{net capital gains}$.
-   **Business savings** — retained earnings, ie. the profit that they don’t distribute to owners and shareholders as dividends.
-   **Government savings** — also called government budget balance.

_National saving_ is the sum of household, business and government saving, minus expenditures.

-   $NS(r)= S(r)+\text{Business Savings} + \text{Gov. Savings}$, where business and government savings are exogenous variables, that is, variables whose value are determined by factors outside the current model.
    -   $\text{Private savings} = Y-T-C$.
    -   $\text{Gov. savings} = T-G$.

**National Saving (Supply) and Investment Demand:**

Combining the national saving curve with the investment demand curve, we get an aggregate supply and demand graph curve for a closed economy. Remember, both curves depend on the real interest rate $r$.

Note: when the RBA sets a higher interest rate, that means higher borrowing costs, so people will tend to save instead of invest. Consequently, demand for goods & services decreases overall, causing production to slow, causing inflation to fall. Likewise, setting a lower interest rate encourages households to consume more and businesses to invest more.

-   When interest rates rise, it will be harder for companies to accumulate capital goods (since they’ll have to pay more interest on the bonds they issue). This tends to lower the price of a company’s stock.
