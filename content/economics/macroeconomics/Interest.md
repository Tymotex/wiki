Interest is the *cost of borrowing money*. Borrowing money enables you to acquire goods and services you that will produce value. Lending $\$100$ is only worth doing with the expectation that you get some amount greater than $\$100$ back. Lending $\$100$ makes poorer, reducing your ability to acquire goods and services that will produce value, hence you want to be compensated for *more than you have lent*. 'Interest' literally means 'compensation for loss' from the Latin word 'interesse'.

When you make a deposit of $\$100$ to a [[economics/macroeconomics/Private Banks|private bank]], you're forgoing the privilege of being able to use that $\$100$ with the expectation of being paid a certain interest rate for letting the bank do what it wants with you money. Note that although [[economics/macroeconomics/Private Banks|private banks]] each set their own interest rates on savings accounts and on loans, they're all directly influenced by the [[economics/macroeconomics/Cash Rate|interest rate]] set by the [[economics/macroeconomics/Central Bank|central bank]].

Remember, the economy is not a [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game). In theory, the act of lending/borrowing should result in a win-win scenario and create a net increase in 'value' in the game (economy). The [economic pie tends to keep on growing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_the_pie).

> Fundamentally, the concept of *interest* exists because all humans value something more when they can use it today versus tomorrow because life is finite.

Interestingly, the [Islamic banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_banking_and_finance) system prohibits monetary interest for religious reasons, instead it sets up other non-monetary incentive structures to reward lenders.

## Nominal vs. Real Interest
**Nominal interest rate** — return on loan in terms of *money*.

- [ZLB (zero lower-bound problem)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_lower_bound#:~:text=The%20Zero%20Lower%20Bound%20(ZLB,capacity%20to%20stimulate%20economic%20growth.): prior to the global financial crisis in 2007-08, people considered that nominal interest rate $i$ should be bounded by zero, that is $i \geq 0$.

**Real interest rate** — return on loan in terms of *purchasing power*. The real interest rate is given by the difference between the nominal interest rate and inflation rate: $r \approx i - \pi$, where $i$ is nominal interest rate and $\pi$ is the inflation rate *over the period of the loan* (eg. 1 year).

- If you want to earn a real interest rate of 5%, and you’re expecting inflation to be 2%, then you should set the nominal interest rate to be 7%.

## Fisher Effect
The **Fisher Effect** asserts that nominal interest rate will increase 1:1 with inflation, ie. that each 1% rise in inflation will have a corresponding 1% rise in nominal interest rate.
