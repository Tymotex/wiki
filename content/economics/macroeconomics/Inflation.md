Inflation describes a period where *prices in an economy are increasing*, or alternatively, the decline of the purchasing power of a country’s currency. Likewise, *deflation* describes a period where prices are falling.

The inflation rate describes a value for how much the prices for goods and services have increaseed in an economy from one point of time to the another.

The [[economics/macroeconomics/Central Bank|central bank]] measures inflation using a *price index*, which is a value that is representative of the aggregate price level. One standard and very commonly chosen price index central banks use to measure inflation is the [[economics/macroeconomics/Inflation#Consumer Price Index|consumer price index (CPI)]].

Inflation is measured in terms of the CPI between the current year, $CPI$, and its previous year, $CPI_{-1}$:
$$
	\pi=\big( \frac{CPI-CPI_{-1}}{CPI_{-1}} \big) \times 100
$$

We can think of inflation simply as the percentage change in CPI between two periods. 

Note: we use $\pi$ as the symbol for inflation.




- Increasing the [[economics/macroeconomics/Cash Rate|cash rate]] tends to reduce the inflation rate



- **Cost-push inflation** is when the costs of a business producing goods and services rises (due to shortages in materials, increases in wage, etc.), causing the price of those goods and services charged to consumers to rise. This assumes demand for the business' output hasn't changed.
- **Demand-pull inflation** is when the demand for a good or service increases while the supply doesn't, causing prices to rise for that good or service.

## Why Inflation Exists

Remember, inflation is just the phenomenon of money having lower purchasing power than before. 

Reasons why money might have lower purchasing power include:
- An increase in the [[economics/macroeconomics/Money#Money Supply|money supply]] that grows faster than real output. [[economics/macroeconomics/Quantity Theory|Quantity theory]] proposes that the value of money is determined in the same way that almost everything is — *supply and demand*.

## How Inflation Happens
A rise in the prices of one commodity or service has a ripple effect that causes a rise in many other things. The price levels of goods and services are very often tightly coupled in this way.

## Optimal Inflation Rate
It’s typically desirable for economies to maintain a low and stable inflation rate over time, usually in the ballpark of 1-3% per year.

Having an inflation rate above zero will tend to grow the economy. Although highly contended, [[economics/macroeconomics/Income-Expenditure Model|Keynesian economics]] argues in the short-run, it takes some time for the decrease in purchasing power of money to fall, so there is a 'window of opportunity' where before inflation 'kicks in', prices all stay the same allowing people or businesses with more money to acquire more goods & services, growing the country's real GDP. This is what governments may try to exploit to grow the economy, but it's a move that has historically backfired hard for some economies.

Aiming for an inflation rate of around 1-3% reduces the likelihood of deflation, which is usually agreed to be more destructive than a little bit of inflation. For example, in deflationary periods, when you expect prices in the future to be lower, then you might hold off on purchasing. Preventing a transaction like this causes businesses to have lower income, resulting in higher unemployment and lower productivity in an economy.

High inflation tends to be self-reinforcing. When too high, it's easy for countries to lose the ability to control the escalation towards hyperinflation, which amplifies all the [[economics/macroeconomics/Inflation#Undesirable Effects of Inflation|undesirable effects of inflation]].

## Undesirable Effects of Inflation

- Inflation is generally bad for your savings because the same amount of money will purchase fewer goods and services in the future. During inflation, you’re incentivised to minimise holdings of currency and ‘store’ wealth in other assets.
- Inflation can be particularly bad for some parties when it’s *unanticipated*.
    - Eg. Suppose a bank loans you $1000 with an interest rate calculated based on its *expected rate of inflation* for the loan period. If the inflation is in fact higher than what the bank expected, then you will be repaying the loan in dollars with less purchasing power. Ie. there has been an unintended redistribution of real wealth in your favour, as the borrower.
- **Menu costs** — the cost of having to *literally* re-printing physical menus to reflect new cost, or any other process that needs to take place to update costs of items in a high-inflation environment.
- **Shoe-leather cost** — the real cost of making transactions with banks.
    - When the inflation rate is high, people are usually incentivised to buy and hold more interest-bearing assets.
    - The term ‘shoe-leather’ cost is the cost associated with *literally* wearing out the shoe leather each time you take a physical trip to the bank (back in the early 2000s, that is). Generally however, shoe-leather cost refers to the real cost of making transactions with banks. Inflation increases the transactions you’d make with the bank since you’d want to minimise the amount of currency you have (because they’re decreasing in value).


The poorer bracket of people in society tend to have a higher [[economics/macroeconomics/Income-Expenditure Model#Consumption Function|marginal propensity to consume]]. A reduction in purchasing power of their money will hurt them more than more affluent individuals. Poorer households typically have less assets that act as a *hedge* against inflation, such as real estate or gold.
