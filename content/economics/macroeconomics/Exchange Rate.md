The exchange rate is the pricing of one country's currency relative to other currencies.

*Bilateral nominal exchange rate* is rate at which two countries can exchange their currencies. In Australia, we express the exchange rate towards every other foreign currency like $e=\frac{\text{Foreign Currency}}{AUD}$. A higher $e$ means that $\$1 \text{ AUD}$ buys more of that foreign currency.

*Bilateral real exchange rate* measures the price of domestic goods & services relative to the price of the same foreign goods & services. It's useful to use a price index like the CPI to compare the prices of goods and services broadly in different economies.
The real exchange rate, $\frac{e\times P_\text{home}}{P_\text{foreign}}$, gives some measure of *international competitiveness*. If a country's goods & services become less expensive, that is $P_\text{home}$ becomes lower, then it'll tend to have higher net exports.

## Models of Nominal Exchange Rate

### Law of One Price
The *Law of One Price* asserts that a tradable good should be priced the same irrespective of where it's coming from (after the application of taxes and transportation costs). If this is not the case (which it indeed isn't in practice), people can exploit the price difference and make a profit.

### Purchasing Power Parity
The *purchasing power parity* is an idea that extends the *Law of One Price* to a general basket of goods and services instead of just one good or service. It asserts that the exchange rate between two currencies will change to reflect the price levels within the two countries, ie. that 

$$e=\frac{P_\text{foreign}}{P_\text{home}}.$$ 
A rise in prices in the home country will reduce $e$, making it so that the home currency purchases less of the foreign currency.
