**Public debt**, also called *government debt* or *national debt*, is the financial liabilities of the government. Since raising taxes is not always reasonable, nearly all governments have to borrow money from the [[economics/macroeconomics/Sectors|private sector]] to meet their expenses. The main way governments borrow money is buy selling *securities* known as **[[economics/macroeconomics/Bonds|government bonds]]**. 

The government's *budget balance* is expressed as: 
$$
	BB=T-G,
$$
where $T$ is taxes and $G$ is government spending.
- When $BB < 0$, we say there's a **budget deficit**.
- When $BB > 0$, we say there's a **budget surplus**.

The governments debt at a time $t$ is expressed as $D_t = D_{t-1} - BB_t$, basically the previous debt minus the *budget balance* over the time between $t-1$ and $t$.

### Golden Rule of Public Investment
A golden rule for public investment says:
- Government expenditures that benefit the current taxpayers should be paid for using *their* taxes.
- Government investments that are long-lived, such as the construction of hospitals, should be funded through government borrowing.

The aim is to be fairer to each generation. Your children shouldnâ€™t have to pay off debts that paid for things which you can enjoy now but which they cannot enjoy in their time.

### Government Budget Constraint
The government budget constraint equation is given as:
$$
\begin{align}
	-(T_t-G_t) &= D_t-D_{t-1} \\ 
	-(\tilde{T_t} - TR_t - rD_{t-1} - G_t)&= D_t - D_{t-1},\\
\end{align}
$$
rearranging terms, we have:
$$
	\underbrace{G_t+TR_t+rD_{t-1}}_{\text{Expenses}} = \underbrace{\tilde{T_t} + D_t - D_{t-1}}_{\text{Funding sources}}.
$$
Remember, $T_t=\tilde{T_t}-TR_t-rD_{t-1}$ consists of tax revenue $\tilde{T_t}$ , transfer payments $TR_t$ and interest on debt $rD_{t-1}$. 

We call the equation above the government 'budget constraint' because we can see that the only way to fund expenses is to either raise taxes or borrow.

### Sustainability of Public Debt
The *debt-to-GDP ratio* is the standard way we assess whether a country's total public debt is sustainable in the long-term. 

Australia's public debt-to-GDP ratio is sitting at ~60% as of 2022, which is regarded as sustainable. Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio, however, is at about +200%, the highest of any developed country. Public debt may be owed to domestic households or firms, or foreign residents.

An equation for the change in debt-to-GDP ratio is derived from:

$$
\begin{align}
	D_t &= D_{t-1} - BB_t \\
	&=D_{t-1}+rD_{t-1}-(\tilde{T_t}-G_t - TR_t) \\
	&=D_{t-1}+rD_{t-1}-PBB_t \\
	\frac{D_t}{Y_t}	&=\frac{D_{t-1}(1+r)}{Y_t}-\frac{PBB_t}{Y_t}
\end{align}
$$

Assuming GDP grows at a constant rate $g$, we can use $Y_t=Y_{t-1}(1+g)$ to obtain:

$$
\begin{align}
	\frac{D_t}{Y_t} &= \frac{D_{t-1}(1+r)}{Y_{t-1}(1+g)}-\frac{PBB_t}{Y_t} \\
	d_t&= \frac{d_{t-1}(1+r)}{1+g}-pbb_t\\
	d_t-d_{t-1}&= \frac{(r-g)d_{t-1}}{1+g} - pbb_t \\
	\Delta d_t &= \frac{(r-g)d_{t-1}}{1+g} - pbb_t.
\end{align}
$$
-   $g$ is the real growth rate of GDP.
-   $r$ is the real interest rate.
-   $PBB=\tilde{T_t}-G_t - TR_t$ is the *primary budget balance*, consisting of taxes $\tilde{T_t}$, government bond interest payments $G_t$, and transfer payments $TR_t$.
-   $pbb_t=\frac{PBB}{Y}$.

From the above equation, running a budget surplus (ie. making $pbb_t$ positive) is the best way to reduce debt. Alternatively, if you can achieve $r<g$, then you can still reduce debt that way.

In general, a higher public debt to GDP ratio results in a reduction in real GDP growth.

**Crowding out:**
See [[economics/macroeconomics/Savings and Investments|savings and investment]]. When the government borrows more, it tends to shift the national savings curve to the left (remember that national savings is a function of government balance), causing the equilibrium real interest rate to rise and therefore the investment demand curve to fall.
