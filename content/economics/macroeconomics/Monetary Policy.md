Monetary policy is a modification of the [[economics/macroeconomics/Monetary Policy#Money Supply|supply of money]] by the [[economics/macroeconomics/Central Bank|Central bank]], usually in an effort to reduce [[economics/macroeconomics/Inflation|inflation]], [[economics/macroeconomics/Interest|interest rates]] or some other macroeconomic variable, to ensure the stability of a country’s currency, minimal unemployment rate, and general welfare of citizens. 

This is achieved by tweaking a variable called an *instrument* that these macroeconomic variables, of which the central banks can’t directly control, depend on.

### Money Supply
Money supply is the amount of [[economics/macroeconomics/Money|money]] circulating in the economy. It can be a measure of currency, M1, or other standard measures of money.
