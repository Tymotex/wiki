### Balance of Payments
The *balance of payments* is a recod of transactions between residents and foreigners. It consists of the *current account* and the *capital and financial account*
- Current account: $\text{Curr. Account = }NX + \text{Primary income}+\text{Transfers}$.
	- Goods and services trade $NX=X-M$
	- Factor income flows, called *net primary income*: $\text{Payments to us} - \text{Payments to other countries' residents}$
	- Transfer payments (including international aid, for example)
- Capital and financial account: $\text{Cap. \& Fin. Account = Balance on Cap. Account + Balance on Fin. Account}$.
	- Capital account: the acquisition/disposal of non-financial assets, and capital transfers.
	- Financial account: the trade of financial assets between residents and foreigners.

It should be the case (in accounting) that $\text{Current Account} + \text{Cap. \& Fin. Account} = 0$. In practice, there are measurement errors causing $\text{Current Account} \approx -\text{Cap. \& Fin. Account}$. The difference is called the *net errors and omissions*.

### Savings and Investment in Open Economies
See [[economics/macroeconomics/Savings and Investments|savings and investments]].

The savings of other countries can be invested into domestic capital.

Consider a *small open economy* that is small enough that its trade activity does not affect a global real world interest rate $r^w$.
