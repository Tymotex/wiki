- Is there a best time to visit the destination?

## Packing List

**Conditional items**:
- Sunscreen.
- Mosquito repellent.

## Airlines
There are 4 major airlines: Qantas, Virgin, Jetstar and Tigerair. 
- Qantas and Virgin cost more than Jetstar and Tigerair.
- Jetstar and Tigerair receive slightly worse customer satisfaction.
- Safety standards are the same across all 4.
    - As of 2022, none of them have caused fatalities in recent years ([source](https://www.choice.com.au/travel/on-holidays/airlines/articles/australian-domestic-airlines-compared)).
    - Qantas owns Jetstar and Virgin owns Tigerair. The safety standards are apparently equivalent.
    
## Accommodation

## Reducing Costs
Plane tickets are typically cheapest:
- When you book well in advance of when you plan to leave (between 3 weeks to 4 months in advance).
- Tuesdays and Wednesdays, apparently.

Prices are determined by the supply and demand model. Pick a time when people are least able or willing to travel to your destination for cheapest prices.

## Travel Agencies
Travel agencies handle a lot of the complexity with trip planning. DIY travel planning is usually considerably cheaper.
