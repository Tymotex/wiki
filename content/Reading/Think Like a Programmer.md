Problem-solving and coding are independent skills. You can be excellent at one and poor at the other. Problem-solving is fundamentally a creative activity, it is about crafting algorithms that perform a task under stated *constraints*.

Understanding all the constraints of a problem is crucial. **Without fully understanding the constraints, you will pigeonhole yourself to exploiting a smaller set of actions**.
> If you are unaware of all possible actions you could take, you may be unable to solve the problem.

> Restating the problem in a more formal manner is a great technique for gaining insight into a problem.

**By articulating the problem yourself, you can reveal the real constraints**. This is why 'rubber duck' debugging is so effective â€” it makes you challenge initial assumptions.

When a problem looks really hard, **make a smaller version of the problem** and try solve that instead. You do this by:
1. Removing constraints.
2. Reducing the size of the problem's sample, eg. instead of solving the problem for a 10x10 grid, can you solve it for a 4x4 grid?
3. Dividing the problem into smaller subproblems.

Stay alert and **look for *analogies*** (common patterns) between the current problem and other problems you've encountered in the past.

**Always have a plan**. Never stumble around blindly. Approach the problem with intermediate goals rather than with the goal of solving the problem. It's important to do this for psychological reasons because solving intermediate goals gives you more confidence you'll eventually get to the solution. When you're frustrated, you can't problem-solve.

A reliably good first step in your problem-solving plan is to *restate the problem* and its constraints formally. When working with other people, this serves to confirm your understanding of the problem as well.
