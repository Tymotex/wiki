Problem-solving and coding are independent skills. You can be excellent at one and poor at the other.

Problem-solving is fundamentally a creative activity, it is about crafting an algorithm that performs a task under stated *constraints*.

Understanding all the constraints of a problem is crucial. **Without fully understanding the constraints, you will pigeonhole yourself to exploiting a smaller set of actions**.
> If you are unaware of all possible actions you could take, you may be unable to solve the problem.

> Restating the problem in a more formal manner is a great technique for gaining insight into a problem.

**By articulating the problem yourself, you can reveal the real constraints**. This is why 'rubber duck' debugging is so effective â€” it makes you challenge initial assumptions.

When a problem looks really hard, **make it smaller** and try solve that instead.



- Fox, goose, corn problem.
    - Restating the problem helps to identify all the real constraints and therefore more choices that are available for you to exploit.
- Sliding tiles problem.
    - Make a much smaller version of the problem and try to solve that instead.
