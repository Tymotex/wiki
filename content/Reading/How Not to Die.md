title: How Not to Die
---

âš  There is a lot of criticism directed to the claims made in this book, and counter-studies against those claims. Remember to be skeptical but open-minded to arguments made for and against Greger's recommendations.

TODO: I should try aggressively cutting down consumption of meat, dairy and processed foods for around 2 months and get my blood tested before and after.

TODO: shopping list:
- Flaxseeds (preferably ground).
- Cocoa powder.
	- Goji berries.
- Lemon tahini sauce.
- Horseradish.
- Turmeric root.
- Thai red curry recipe.
	- Thai red curry paste, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, chicken broth, green beans, thai basil, coconut milk 
- Red or purple cabbage.
	- Chili seeds (scorpion variety).
- Soybeans (any. Could try edamame first).
- Matcha.
- Amla powder from Indian stores.
- Date sugar (only as a last resort alternative to sugar).

TODO: plan your daily dozen recipes.
- Spicy bean burritos
	- Homemade tortillas
- Blueberry and banana 'ice cream'
- Flaxseed muffins
- Milkshake with soy milk, blueberries, banana, ground flaxseed, and optionally cocoa powder.
- Indian curry.
	- Note: when eating curcumin, add black pepper.
- Thai curry.
- Healthy fruit pies.

My favourite herbs and spices:
- Chili powder
- Turmeric
- Black pepper
- Oregano
- Cumin seeds
- Cinnamon.
	- It's bad to consume too much of it because it harbours a chemical that can damage the liver.
- Nutmeg.
- Cilantro.
- Mint.
- Ginger.
- Paprika.
- Cloves.

TODO: 
- try cooking beans
- buy broccoli sprout seeds online


Foods to try more of:
- Kale. Kale smoothie seems really good.
- Broccoli and cruciferous vegetables in general.
	- Mum must eat more of broccoli sprouts also.
- Turmeric for curcumin.
- Oatmeal (for fibre).
- Berries.
- Nuts, seeds and grains.
	- Mum must try flaxseeds.
- Beets (especially beet juice)
- Cranberry (try the cocktail recipe given in the book, with blended mint).
	- Ginger, it's so good. (Try making tea with it and lemon)



> Our diet is the number-one cause of premature death and the number-one cause of disability.

> ... **the science shows that our genes often account for only 10-20% of risk at most**.

The incentive structure for healthcare rewards the treatment of symptoms and lessening of pain through drugs and surgery rather than through the treatment of root causes or preventative treatment through diet and exercise. Due to that, the revolutionary findings of the effects of diet and exercise have failed to propagate effectively through society, and health professionals rarely have adequate training in nutrition.
> After Dr. Ornish proved that heart disease could be reversed without drugs or surgery, he thought that his studies would have a meaningful effect on the practice of mainstream medicine. After all, he effectively found a cure for our number-one killer! But he was mistaken, not about his critically important findings regarding diet and disease reversal but about **how much influence the business of medicine has on the practice of medicine**.

The author strongly encourages whole-food plant-based diets, claiming it to the be the type of diet that seems to reliably reduce risks of disease in studies.
> ... healthy eating may be "best achieved with a plant-based diet, which we define as a regimen that encourages whole, plant-based foods and discourages meats, dairy products, and eggs as well as all refined and processed foods"

## Cardiac Health
There is a claim in the book that fish and fish oil supplements do not improve cardiac health:
> A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at all the best randomised clinical trials evaluating the effects of omega-3 fats on life span, cardiac death, sudden death, heart attack, and stroke... Overall, the researchers found **no protective benefit** for overall mortality, heart disease mortality, sudden cardiac death, heart attack, or stroke.

High LDL cholesterol levels are said to be the main cause of coronary heart disease.
> To drastically reduce LDL cholesterol levels, you need to drastically reduce your intake of 3 things: trans fat, which comes from processed foods and naturally from meat and dairy; saturated fat, found mainly in animal products and junk foods; and to a lesser extent dietary cholesterol, found exclusively in animal-derived foods, especially eggs.

> An LDL around 70 mg/dL corresponds to a total cholesterol reading of about 150 mg/dL, the level below which no deaths from coronary heart disease were reported in the famous Framingham Heart Study... To become virtually heart-attack proof, **you need to get your LDL cholesterol at least under 70 mg/dL**.

Statins are praised for lowering LDL cholesterol, however there are a number of negative health impacts. Some research shows it makes you more likely to have diabetes and invasive breast cancer.
> Plant-based diets have been shown to lower cholesterol just as effectively as first-line statin drugs, but without the risks.

> Certain foods, such as meats, appear to harbour bacteria that can trigger inflammation dead or alive, even when the food is fully cooked. Endotoxins are not destroyed by cooking temperatures, stomach acid, or digestive enzymes, so after a meal of animal products, these endotoxins may end up in your intestines... ferried by saturated fat across the gut wall into your bloodstream, where they can trigger the inflammatory reaction in your arteries.

> Dr. Ornish reported a 91% reduction in angina attacks within just a few weeks in patients placed on a plant-based diet both with or without exercise.

> ... just a single serving of 4 Brazil nuts almost immediately improved cholesterol levels. LDL cholesterol levels were a staggering 20 points lower just 9 hours after eating the Brazil nuts. Even drugs don't work nearly that fast.

A caveat is that Brazil nuts are incredibly high in selenium, pushing you to the daily limit very quickly.

Kale is also incredibly effective at lowering LDL and increasing HDL cholesterol.
> Researchers took 30 men with high cholesterol and had them consume 3 to 4 shots of kale juice a day for 3 months.... What the kale did do was substantially lower their bad (LDL) cholesterol and boost their good (HDL) cholesterol as much as running 300 miles.

## Lung Health
Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, seem to aid substantially in fighting and prevent cancer.
> Compared to broccoli-avoiding smokers, the broccoli-eating smokers suffered 41% fewer DNA mutations in their bloodstream over 10 days.

In a petri dish of lung cancer cells, exposure to cruciferous vegetables stunted cancer creep.

An experiment involved comparing the DNA mutations on bacteria caused by the carcinogens present in the urine of smokers and non-smokers. Interestingly, the curcumin pigment present in turmeric was helpful in reducing DNA mutation rates in smokers.
> Unsurprisingly, scientists who tried this experiment found that the urine from non-smokers caused far fewer DNA mutations... But when the smokers were given turmeric, the DNA-mutation rate dropped by up to 38%... They merely got less than a teaspoon a day of just the regular turmeric spice you'd find at the grocery store.

A large portion of the non-smokers that develop lung cancer can be attributed to second-hand smoke and to frying fumes.
> When fat is heated to frying temperatures, whether it be animal fat, such as lard, or plant fat, such as vegetable oil, toxic volatile chemicals with mutagenic properties (those able to cause genetic mutations) are released into the air. **This happens even before the the smoke point temperature is reached**. If you do fry at home, **good ventilation** in the kitchen may reduce lung cancer risk.

The grilling of meat can release polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which has been shown to reduce the birth weight and head size of babies when their mother has been exposed to them. The harmful effect of high PAH levels have led to researchers advocating against living near the exhaust of restaurants (especially Chinese restaurants which frequently pan fry fish).

Cooking bacon releases a carcinogenic fume containing nitrosamines.
> If you do need to be around frying bacon or eggs, it would be safer to limit your exposure by using a backyard grill. Studies show that the number of particles deposited into the lungs increases by a factor of 10 when frying indoors versus outdoors.

## Brain Health
> The 2 most serious brain diseases are stroke, which kills nearly 130000 Americans each year, and Alzheimer's disease, which kills nearly 85000.

Fibre is incredibly useful for reducing risks towards cancers and diseases.
> In addition to its well-known effects on bowel health, high fibre intake appears to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon and breast, diabetes, heart diseases, obesity, and premature death in general. A number of studies now show that high fibre intake may also help ward off stroke.

 > ... fibre helps control your cholesterol and blood sugar levels, which can help reduce the amount of artery-clogging plaque in your brain's blood vessels.

Cholesterol is not only a primary risk factor for heart disease, it is also a huge contributor to the risk of Alzheimer's:
> ... autopsies have demonstrated that Alzheimer's patients had particularly significant arterial blockage in he arteries leading to the memory centres of their brains. In light of such findings, some experts have even suggested that Alzheimer's be reclassified as a vascular disorder... Too much cholesterol in your blood... is unanimously recognised as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.

> Under an electron microscope, we can see the clustering of amyloid fibres on and around tiny crystals of cholesterol. And indeed, advanced brain imaging techniques, such as PET scans, have shown a direct correlation between the amount of LDL cholesterol in the blood and amyloid buildup in the brain.

Berries (due to their polyphenols) have been shown to reduce cognitive decline in older adults.
> in 2012... the diets and health of 16000 women were followed starting i 1980. They found that women who consumed at least one serving of blueberries and 2 servings of strawberries each week had slower rates of cognitive decline, by as much as two and a half years, compared with those who didn't eat berries.

> Beyond their antioxidant activity, polyphenols have been shown to protect nerve cells in vitro by inhibiting the formation of the plaques and tangles that characterise Alzheimer's disease.

AGEs (advanced glycation end products), thought to accelerate aging exist in greatest amounts in meat, dairy, processed foods. They're formed when fat and protein are subjected to high temperatures.
> The researchers recommend cooking meat using moist-heat cooking methods, such as steaming or stewing, but even boiled fish has more than 10 times more AGEs than a sweet potato roasted for an hour.

Exercise has been shown to reverse shrinkage of brain volume caused by aging and neurodegenerative disease:
> Subsequent studies using MRI scans found that aerobic exercise can actually reverse age-related shrinkage in the memory centers of the brain.

## Digestive Health
Phytates, a stored form of phosphorus found in seeds, nuts, grains, legumes, were shown to be effective at suppressing cancer:
> Petri-dish studies have shown that phytates inhibit the growth of virtually all human cancer cells tested so far, including cancers of the colon, breast, cervix, prostate, liver pancreas, and skin, while leaving normal cells alone.

The NIH-AARP study following 545000 men and women made the following conclusion:
> **Meat consumption was associated with increased risk of dying from cancer, dying from heart disease, and dying prematurely in general**. Again, this was after controlling for other diet and lifestyle factors, effectively excluding the possibility that people who ate meat also smoked more, exercised less, or failed to eat their fruits and veggies.

Heme iron (sourced from meat) is suspected as a significant contributor to cancer rates. Non-heme iron (sourced from plants) is less likely to push your body to a dangerous surplus.
> ... iron can generate cancer-causing free radicals by acting as a pro-oxidant... The human body has no specific mechanism to rid itself of excess iron.

Fibre seems to solve many problems:
> Our bodies were designed to expect an every-flowing fibre stream, so it dumps such unwanted waste products as excess cholesterol and estrogen into the intestines assuming they will be swept away... Only 3% of Americans may even reach the recommended *minimum* daily intake of fibre.

## Infections
Blueberries increase the number of natural killer cells.
> In one study researchers asked athletes to eat about a cup and a half of blueberries every day for six weeks to see if the berries could reduce the oxidative stress caused by long-distance running. The blueberries succeeded, unsurprisingly, but a more important finding was their effect on natural killer cells... consuming blueberries actually doubled their killer cell counts, to more than 4 billion.

The massive amounts of antibiotics fed to animals are inevitably passed to us, resulting in antibiotic-resistant pathogens
> In the U.S., meat producers feed millions of pounds of antibiotics each year to farm animals just to promote growth or prevent disease in the often cramped, stressful, and unhygienic conditions of industrial animal agriculture.

Pathogens originating from animals such as E. coli, salmonella, C. diff are far more challenging to kill on kitchen surfaces and through cooking than we thought.

## Diabetes
> More than 20 million Americans are currently diagnosed with diabetes, a tripling of cases since 1990. At this rate, the CDC predicts that 1 in 3 Americans will be diabetic by midcentury.

> Interestingly, the number of individual fat cells in your body doesn't change much in adulthood, no matter how much weight you gain or lose. They just swell up with fat as the body gains weight, so when your belly gets bigger, you're not necessarily creating new fat cells; rather, you're just cramming more fat into existing ones.

## Blood Pressure
> The number-one risk factor for death in the world they identified is high blood pressure. Also known as hypertension, high blood pressure lays waste to 9 million people worldwide every year.

Sodium appears to a primary cause of high blood pressure (among other things).
> After a high-sodium meal, there is significantly less blood flow unless vitamin C is injected into the skin, which appears to reverse much of the sodium-induced suppression of blood vessel function.

> The poultry industry commonly injects chicken carcasses with salt water to artificially inflate their weight, yet they can still be labelled "100% natural".

The observed blood pressure of adolescents through to people 60+ years old in rural Africa and China (who have extremely low-sodium plant-based diets) is 110/70.
> ... the ideal blood pressure, defined as the level at which lowering it further yields no additional benefit, is probably around 110/70.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, flaxseeds were able to reduce blood pressure of hypertensive participants from 158/82 to 143/75, which is more effective than the leading medications for reducing blood pressure.

> Tested head-to-head against a leading blood pressure drug, two cups of strong hibiscus tea every morning was as effective in lowering subjects' blood pressure as a starting dose of the drug Captopril taken twice a day.

Nitric oxide (NO) causes vasodilation. It's created from nitrates in our diet, of which dark green leafy vegetables are a great source of (and beets, rhubarb, and others).

Interestingly, nitrates enable your body to extract more energy from oxygen.
> For example, one little shot of beet juice has been found to allow free divers to hold their breath for a half minute longer than usual. After sipping beet juice, cyclists were able to perform at the same level of intensity while consuming 19 % less oxygen than the placebo group.

> To maximise athletic performance, the ideal dose and timing appears to be a half cup of beet juice (or 3 three-inch beets, or a cup of cooked spinach) two to three hours before a competition.

## Liver Disease
> When it came to suppressing the growth of human liver cancer cells in a petri dish, cranberries beat out the other most common fruits in the United States... Other studies have found that cranberries are also effective in vitro against additional cancers, including those of the brain, breast, colon, lung, mouth, ovary, prostate, and stomach. Unfortunately, there have yet to be clinical studies of the effects of cranberries on cancer patients that confirm these findings.

## Kidney Disease
Animal proteins tend to cause the kidney to enter a state of 'hyperfiltration', while plant proteins don't. This is thought to be caused by the inflammation in response to animal products in the body.

Phosphate salts are commonly injected into chicken meat to increase its weight and colour. Phosphates, however, are known to be 'vascular toxins' and almost entirely get absorbed into the bloodstream, just like heme iron.
> It's easy to avoid added phosphorus in processed foods â€” just don't buy anything containing ingredients with the word "phosphate" in their names... With meat, it's more difficult to determine the phosphate content, as producers aren't required to disclose injected additives... Chicken appears to be the worst offender: A supermarket survey found more than 90% of chicken products contained phosphate additives.

Nitrosamines are a known carcinogen found in cigarette smoke and meat (especially processed meat). They're accepted as a large risk factor for kidney cancer
> Around 80% of nitrosamines from cigarette smoke can remain in a room, even with normal ventilation, so always try to choose smoke-free hotel rooms. Nitrosamines are one of the reasons you can't smoke indoors without endangering others, even if you smoke without anyone present.

> ... one hot dog has as many nitrosamines as 4 cigarettes and that these carcinogens are also found in fresh meat including beef, chicken, and pork...

Nitrites added to cured meat (for preservation and to provide red/pink colouring). They're also naturally found in plants like celery, however they're not considered harmful because:
> Nitrites themselves are not carcinogenic; they turn into carcinogens. **Nitrites only become harmful when they turn into nitrosamines and nitrosamides**. For them to do that, amines and amides must be present, and amines and amides are found in abundance in animal products. This transformation can happen in the meat itself or in your stomach after you eat it. In the case of plant foods, the vitamin C and other antioxidants that are found naturally in them block the formation of these carcinogens in your body.

## Breast Cancer
> Every year, about 230,000 are diagnosed with breast cancer, and 40,000 die from it.

Even in early detection cases, the tumour has possibly been in development for decades. Modern imaging technology is insufficient for *actual* early detection.
> Autopsy studies have shown that as many as 20% of women aged 20 to 54 who died from unrelated causes, such as car accidents, had so-called "occult" (or hidden) breast cancers growing inside them... Some breast cancer may even start in the womb and be related to your mother's diet.

The doubling in size of a cancer cell can happen anywhere between several days or a few years. Your diet can delay cancer development. You mustn't wait until diagnosis to improve your lifestyle.

> Remarkably, eating a plant-based diet along with walking every day can improve our cancer defenses within just two weeks. Researchers dripped the blood of women before and after 14 days of healthy living onto breast cancer cells growing in petri dishes. The blood take after they started eating healthier suppressed cancer growth significantly better and killed 20-30% more cancer cells than the blood taken from the same women just two weeks before.

Melatonin, which is secreted by your pineal gland into your bloodstream, is used to inform your internal body of the time of day. It has been inversely associated with breast cancer risk (probably because it suppresses cell activity). 
> Studies comparing night-time satellite photos against breast cancer rates have found that people living in brighter neighbourhoods tend to have a higher breast cancer risk.

Light exercise does not seem sufficient for decreasing risk of breast cancer. Moderate intensity exercise for 5 hours each week or more is effective.
> Although even light exercise is associated with lowered risk of some other types of cancer, for breast cancer, leisurely strolls don't appear to cut it.

*Heterocyclic amines* (HCAs) are carcinogenic chemicals formed in the high-temperature cooking of meat, such as roasting, pan frying, grilling, etc. They're also present in cigarette smoke.
> ... the Iowa Women's Health Study found that women who ate their bacon, beefsteak, and burgers "very well done" had nearly five times the odds of getting breast cancer compared with women who preferred these meats served rare or medium.

*PhIP* is one of the most common HCAs found in cooked meat. It's been shown to not only increase risk of cancer, but to also drive the growth of the tumour and metastasis. The aggressiveness of cancer cell spread is measured through observing how strongly the cells can penetrate a membrane in an invasion chamber.
> When researchers placed metastatic breast cancer cells from a 54 year-old woman in an invasion chamber all by themselves, relatively few were able to breach the barrier. But within 72 hours of adding PhIP to the chamber, the cancer cells became more invasive, crawling through the membrane at an accelerated rate.

PhIP is very quickly removed from the body and can reach undetectable levels 24 hours after you refrain from taking more of it into your body. Eating broccoli apparently enhances the liver's ability to get rid of HCAs.

> ... a study of nearly 1500 women found that remarkably simple behaviour changes such as eating just 5 or more servings of fruits and veggies per day along with walking for 30 minutes 6 days a week were associated with... nearly half the risk of dying from their cancer in the 2 years following diagnosis.

A large amount of stems cells, which are 'immortal', exist in breast tissue. 
> Cancerous stem cells may be why breast cancer can return, even up to 25 years after being fought off successfully the first time. When people are told that they are cancer-free, it may mean their tumours are gone, but if their stem cells are cancerous, the tumours still might reappear many years later.

> Sulforaphane, a dietary component of cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, has been shown to suppress the ability of breast cancer stem cells to form tumours. This means that if you're currently in remission, eating lots of broccoli could theoretically help keep your cancer from returning... To reach the concentration of sulforaphane in the breast found to suppress breast cancer stem cells, however, you would have to eat at least a **quarter-cup of broccoli sprouts a day**.

Dietary lignans are found in the highest concentration in flaxseeds. Lignans are phytoestrogens which suppress the effects of estrogen (by binding in estrogen receptors and producing a weakened effect). 
> Breast cancer survivors who have higher levels of lignans in their bloodstreams and diets appear to survive significantly longer.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled study on flaxseed:
> Researchers located women with breast cancer scheduled for surgery and divided them randomly into 2 groups: every day, group one ate a muffin containing flaxseed, while group 2 ate a muffin that looked and tasted the same, but had no flaxseed in it. Biopsies of the tumours in the flax and no-flax groups were taken at the beginning of the study and then compared with the pathology of the tumour removed during surgery about 5 weeks later... Compared with the women who ate the placebo muffins, women consuming the muffins with flaxseed, on average, **witnessed their tumour-cell proliferation decrease, cancer-cell death rates increase, and their c-erB2 (cancer aggressiveness) scores go down**.

Isoflavones are another phytoestrogen, present in high concentrations in soybeans.
 > Overall, researchers have found that **women diagnosed with breast cancer who ate the most soy lived significantly longer and had a significantly lower risk of breast cancer recurrence** than those who ate less.

>  The quantity of phytoestrogens found in just a **single cup of soy milk may** **reduce the risk of breast cancer returning by 25%**.

> In one study, for example, 90% of the breast cancer patients who ate the most soy phytoestrogens after diagnosis were still alive 5 years later, while half of those who ate little to no soy were dead.

The disparity between breast cancer rates in women from Asia and women from North American is thought to be attributed to dietary differences: Asian women tend to consume more green tea, soy, mushrooms
> Asian women are up to 5 times less likely to develop breast cancer than North American women. 

Button mushrooms can block estrogen synthase (which plays an important role in estrogen synthesis) in a petri dish.
> The women whose mushroom consumption averaged just about one-half a mushroom or more per day had 64% lower odds of breast cancer compared with women who didn't eat mushrooms at all.

## Beans
> One of their summary cancer-prevention recommendations is to eat whole grains and/or legumes **with every meal**. Not every week or every day. *Every* meal!
	
- Always prefer organic soybeans over GMO soybeans because they aren't sprayed with pesticides.
- Canned beans are about as nutritious as boiled beans, but prefer cans with no added sodium. The liquid is nutritious.
	- Prefer dried beans for better cost effectiveness and taste unless you want to skip boiling them.
- Add lentils to your rice cooker and it'll be done at the same time.

**Choices**:
- Tofu.
- Tempeh.
- Miso soup.
	- The blood pressure lowering effect of miso soup overall is greater than the hypertensive effects of salt.
- Hummus and other mashed bean dips.
- Sprouted lentils. You can sprout them yourself over a few days.
> 	... when sprouted, their antioxidant power doubles (and even quintuples for chickpeas).

- Black bean brownies.

## Berries
- Prefer colourful fruits and vegetables over plain fruits and vegetables (e.g. red onion over white onion). They tend to be richer in antioxidants. Evolutionarily speaking, they evolved to attract consumption.
	> Colourful foods are often healthier because they contain antioxidant pigments, whether it's the beta-carotene that makes carrots and sweet potatoes orange, the lycopene antioxidant pigment that makes  tomatoes red, or the anthocyanin pigments that make blueberries blue. **The colours *are* the antioxidants.**

- Berries tend to have substantially higher concentrations of antioxidant (a few or several times more than fruits like apples and bananas for the same serving size).
- Frozen berries retain most of the nutrients. Prefer frozen over fresh for cost-effectiveness and storage convenience.
- 

**Choices**:
- Blackberries are best berries for antioxidants that are still commonly available in supermarkets.
- Goji berries.
	- They have the highest concentration of melatonin and studies have credited it with improving sleep quality.
- Frozen berry 'ice-cream'
	- It could literally just a blend of frozen berries (and maybe frozen peeled bananas as well).
	- Optional: cocoa powder, vanilla extract, pitted dates.

## Fruits
- Blending preserves more nutrients than juicing.
- Prefer extra virgin olive oil over more heavily processed olive oil. Even then, excess extra virgin olive oil in your diet can adversely affect cardiovascular health.

**Choices**:
- Kiwifruit
	- Apparently, studies have shown it improves sleep, among other things.
- Citrus fruits.
	> The dietary factor found best able to boos DNS repair was citrus fruit. Within 2 hours of consuming citrus, your DNA becomes significantly more resistant to damage, which may help explain why citrus consumption is associated with lower risk of breast cancer.
	
	- Citrus zest is incredible. 
		> Some of the the citrus compounds thought  which 

## Vegetables


## Cruciferous Vegetables
Because of the presence of sulforphane specifically in cruciferous vegetables, they deserve to be treated as a separate source of foods from the broader set of vegetables.

**Choices**:
- Broccoli.
- Kale.
- Broccoli sprouts (grown on the countertop in a mason jar).

## Greens
*Greens* are basically any chlorophyll-rich foods.
> Dark-green, leafy vegetables are the healthiest foods on the planet. As whole foods go, they offer the most nutrition per calorie.

Try to pair greens with fatty plant foods such as nuts, seeds and avocadoes, because this will increase the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients such as beta-carotene, lutein, vitamin K, zeaxanthin. Snack on some nuts after a salad and that should be sufficient for improving absorption of fat-soluble nutrients.

**Choices**:
- Kale (prefer black and red over green, but prefer green over none at all).
- Microgreens (especially homegrown in trays/mason jars).

## Other Vegetables
It's important to diversify your diet to encompass many types of vegetables, not just a small set of vegetables. Averaging out the nutritional profile of many different vegetables tends to give the best outcome. Some foods harbour nutrients not found in high concentrations elsewhere. For example:
- *Myconutrients* found in mushrooms don't exist in anything in the plant kingdom.
- Some fruits and vegetables target are very effective at suppressing a specific cancer and virtually useless against others.
	> Radishes, for example, are completely unable to stop pancreatic cancer cell growth. However, radishes were 100% effective at halting the growth of stomach cancer cells.

- Cooking vegetables destroys some nutrients, like vitamin C, however other nutrients become more readily absorbable when cooked.
	- The extent to which you can cook certain vegetables varies massively and with the cooking method used. For example, red bell peppers have most of their antioxidants destroyed when roasted while cooking carrots by any method should increase the absorbable antioxidants.
	- Just avoid deep frying vegetables because acrylamide is formed.
	- Boiling tends to cause some nutrients to leach out into the water, but is the best option for certain vegetables.

**Choices**:
- Sweet potatoes.
	- Don't peel sweet potatoes. They are rich in antioxidants (10 times richer than the flesh).
- Garlic.


Always wash fruits and vegetables to minimise pesticide exposure. The most cost-effective way is probably to use 10% saltwater to rinse them.
> Pesticide residues have been detected in 11% of organic crop samples due to accidental or fraudulent use, cross-contamination from neighbouring non-organic fields, or the lingering presence of persistent pollutants like DDT in the soil.

## Nuts and Seeds
- Walnuts have "among the highest antioxidants and omega-3 levels, and they beat out other nuts in vitro in suppressing cancer cell growth."
	> Of all the nuts studied in PREDIMED, the researchers found the greatest benefits associated with walnuts, particularly for preventing cancer deaths. People who ate more than three servings of walnuts per week appeared to cut their risk of dying from cancer in half.

## Herbs and Spices

> If you consume the same amount of curcumin but add a quarter teaspoon of black pepper, the level of curcumin in your blood shoots up by 2,000%.

> Fenugreek appears to significantly improve muscle strength and weight-lifting power output, allowing men in training, for example, to leg press and extra 80lbs compared to those ingesting a placebo.

Ginger apparently is effective for treating headaches (migraines specifically). It is also extremely effective against nausea, comparable to leading drugs.

## Beverages
> Empty your bladder, chug 3 cups of water, and then see how much you pee an hour later. They determined that if you drink 3 cups and urinate less than 1 cup within that hour, there's a good chance you were dehydrated.

> Moderate caffeine consumption in healthy, nonpregnant adults is not only safe but has been found to increase energy and alertness and enhance physical, motor, and cognitive performance.

In general, prefer tea over coffee, and prefer green tea over black tea (which is more processed). White tea is also great, especially when paired with lemon.
> Drinking tea may protect against gynecological malignancies, such as ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer, as well as lower your cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, and body fat. It may protect the brain from both cognitive decline and stroke.

Prefer cold-steeped white tea over hot brew. Some research shows that it produces more absorbable antioxidants.

## Exercise
> Sitting for 6 or more hours a day appears to increase mortality rates even among people who run or swim for an hour a day, ever day, seven days a week.

Exercising seems to cause more oxidative stress due to free radical formation from respiration. Plant-based diets can reduce that.
> As a review in the Journal of Sports Sciences put it, those who eat plant-based diets may naturally "have an enhanced antioxidant defence system to counter exercise-induced oxidative stress."
