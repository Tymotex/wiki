> "Although the basic principles of property investment are similar the world over, fundamental differences exist between Australia and the United States that affect investment strategies, the seeds of which are sown in the **vastly different tax treatments** meted out to property investments in each country."

> Our research and experience suggest that total real estate investment returns are comparable to those from shares (about 7-10% annually, measured over decades).

The authors advise new investors to focus on freestanding houses, especially those in "prime development sites" where it's likely for more apartment towers to be built.
> Apartments make more sense for investors who don't want to deal with building maintenance and security issues.

You should consider opportunities to apply paint, landscaping, upgrading rooms, etc. since they allow for greater rent pricing.
> For higher returns, look for property where relatively simple cosmetic changes can allow you to raise rents, and so increase the market value of the property.

***Your* home (principal place of residence) is not an investment property**. Despite this, home equity is considered a source of security for banks when they're approving further loans.
> The two types of asset have too many differences, particularly when it comes to tax treatment, for them to be talked about as the same thing.

A crucial difference is that the PPoR is not taxed whereas IPs *are* taxed similarly to other investments like shares. 

Prices are almost always negotiable. A common way to negotiate it down is to find flaws in the property and show how much it'd cost to fix them.

> Agents, despite signing agreements with the seller that they'll aim to get the highest price possible, **are interested in the sale first and a high price second**. The promise of a high commission on a property that never sells is pointless for agents â€” they'll never get paid. But if a sale occurs for $20,000 less than the vendor (client) was hoping for, the agent still gets paid.

About exploiting stamp duty exemptions/concessions as a first home buyer:
> These exemptions or reductions don't usually extend to investment properties... qualifying s difficult: You'd be stretching the rules beyond the government's stated intentions and, to meet the requirement that the property is a 'principal place of residence', you'd need to live in the property for a period (usually 1 year) after settlement. Moreover, if you cheat on the rules and you're found out, you face stiff fines.

These exemptions/concessions are not intended to help property investors.

A point raised by the authors is that an interest-only loan is entirely tax deductible.
> Australia's tax laws at the time of writing state that **interest paid on money borrowed to fund investments is tax-deductible**, whereas repayment of investment capital and personal, non-investment debt is *not* deductible.
