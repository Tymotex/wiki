ðŸ’Ž Exercise.

There are primarily 4 sources of death and suffering in today's world. Together, they account for the vast majority of deaths. Reducing your risk for all 4 should massively extend your lifespan and healthspan.
> Four Horsemen: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, or type 2 diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction.

## Exerise
> Exercise is by far the most potent longevity "drug". No other intervention does nearly as much to prolong our lifespan and preserve our cognitive and physical function.

> The data are unambiguous: exercise not only delays actual death but also prevents both cognitive and physical decline, better than any other intervention.

## Caloric Restriction
There is an interesting molecule, rapamycin, that is the only molecule ever shown to extend lifespan of mammals. The effect has been reproduced by many researchers in many environments on many animals, all showing a consistent effect of lifespan extension.
> The reason rapamycin has so many diverse applications is thanks to a property that Sehgal had observed, but never explored, which is that it tends to slow down the process of cellular growth and division.

The reasoning behind why rapamycin extends life is that it interacts with **mTOR** which is a protein complex that basically syncs the availability of nutrients and cell division. Abundant food â†’ mTOR drives cell division. Food scarce â†’ mTOR slows cell division.
> rapamycin acted directly on a very important intracellular protein complex called mTOR. The job of mTOR is basically to balance an organism's need to grow and reproduce against the availability of nutrients. When food is plentiful, mTOR is activated and the cell (or the organism) goes into growth mode, producing new proteins and undergoing cell division, as with the ultimate goal of reproduction. When nutrients are scarce, mTOR is suppressed and cells go into a kind of "recycling" mode, breaking down cellular components and generally cleaning house.

> Reducing the amount of nutrients available to a cell see

The deprivation of nutrients (i.e. eating less) has been historically observed to extend life.
> This idea goes all the way back to Hippocrates, but more modern experiments have demonstrated, over and over, that reducing the food intake of lab animals could lengthen their lives.

The lifespan extension from caloric restriction is quite significant. In mice, it could extend lifespan by â‰¥ 15%.
> The results have been remarkably consistent. Studies dating back to the 1930s have found that limiting caloric intake can lengthen the lifespan of a mouse or a rat by anywhere from 15 to 45%, depending on the age of onset and degree of restriction. Not only that, but the underfed animals also seem to be markedly healthier for their age, developing fewer spontaneous tumours than normally fed mice.
