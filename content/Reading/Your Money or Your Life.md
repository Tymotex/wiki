title: Your Money or Your Life

ðŸ’Ž The only resource you really have is time and willpower. This is the currency you spend to acquire money.

ðŸ’Ž Define *enough*. Until you do, no amount will be enough.

Your only real resource in life is your time and effort. It's the currency you start with in abundance and spend to acquire money. When framed this way, it should become more apparent to you whether you're happy with the life-energy-to-money transactions you are making. Purchasing $50 with one hour of your time and energy may well be worth it if it is sufficient for meeting what you define as *enough*.
> *Money is something you trade your life energy for*. You sell your time for money. It doesn't matter that Ned over there sells his time for a hundred dollars and you sell yours for twenty dollars an hour. Ned's money is irrelevant to you. The only real asset you have is your time.

The world is driven not by greed, but by envy.
> John Stuart Mill once said, "Men do not desire to be rich, only to be richer than other men."

> Stop trying to impress other people. It's an endless and fruitless waste of time and money, plus others are likely so busy trying to impress you that they will, at best, not notice your efforts. At worst, they will resent you for one-upping them.

> Endless desire is one of the pitfalls of human nature, and one of the first things you need to cure if you want to get ahead more quickly.

As an adult, you are entirely free to choose what your relationship to money will be like. You do not need to be bound to pre-existing, deep-seated ideas that were programmed into you as you grew up.
> You are no longer compelled by the parental and social messages you received as a child â€” messages about how we should relate to money in order to be successful, respected, virtuous, secure, and happy. You are free of the confusion you had about money.

It's recommended to track expenses, but you will never find a template that really describes your relationship to money precisely. It is up to you to determine what exactly the categories of spending are. You should add the highest granularity categories you think are reasonable, for instance, instead of 'Food', choose 'Fish', 'Vegetables', etc. or you could subdivide it between 'Indulgence' and 'Survival'. You are encouraged to be as idiosyncratic as you can be here. At higher levels of granularity, it becomes very easy to judge whether or not your expenditures align with your values.
> All such spending patterns will show up if you establish categories that reflect your actual behaviour rather than just writing everything in the budget-book column called 'Food'.

> When it comes to clothing, you may find that you aren't getting enough information about your unique spending patterns by simply having one category called Clothing. You may need to distinguish between utility and fashion.

There is a lot of happiness that can be derived from the simplest pleasures, you need only pay attention while indulging. Being distracted diminishes your enjoyment of even the greatest pleasures in life, but being attentive and present grants you greatest joys from the simplest things.
> There's a word in Spanish that encompasses all this: aprovechar. It means to use something wisely â€” be it a sunny day at the beach or leftovers made into a delicious new meal. It's getting full value from life, enjoying all the good that each moment and each thing has to offer. You can aprovecha a simple meal, a bowl of ripe strawberries, or a cruise in the Bahamas.

Once you get a handle on your life, you may realise that you're part of a larger social fabric. Something integral to happiness is your selfless contributions to that social fabric.
> "A human being is part of a whole, called by us "Universe," a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest â€” a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty." â€” Albert Einstein
