TODO: this is a cool idea: https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries. Do 3 sentence summaries for each book that has made an impact on the way you think.
-   What are the main ideas? Eg. write down the 3-5 best ideas you sourced from the book.
-   If I implemented one idea from this book right now, which one would it be?
-   How would I describe the book to a friend?

TODO: this article is really worth re-reading: https://jamesclear.com/reading-comprehension-strategies.

### Refactoring UI

### Programming TypeScript

### Automate the Boring Stuff

### The Elements of Computing Systems

### Learning React

### Think Like a Programmer
[[Reading/Think Like a Programmer|Think Like a Programmer]] by Anton Spraul. I didn't complete this book since it wasn't introducing many new perspectives to problem-solving. Regardless, the takeaways from this book were helpful in validating what I learned through experience to be helpful in solving problems:
- Always start by articulating the problem in your own words, and write *precisely what the constraints are*.
- *Always have a plan* with intermediate goals.
- Stay alert for *analogies*, i.e. common patterns between the current problem and past problems.

## Biographies
### Man's Search For Meaning
[[Reading/Man's Search For Meaning|Man's Search For Meaning]] by Viktor E. Frankl. This book made me feel capable of having an unbreakable will in moments of extreme suffering and remaining stoic and sanguine independent of predicaments. The passages on Frankl describing his love for his wife made me cry hard.
- It is always possible to be a *good man* in the most hellish of conditions, and to have the strength of character to give away your last ration despite suffering extreme starvation.
- *Meaningful suffering* is integral to mental well-being.
- Love is the ultimate goal to aspire to. Work and love present the most fundamental sources of strength to draw upon when your resolve is tested.

> "He who has a *why* to live for can bear with almost any *how*" â€” Nietzsche.

## Self-Help, Skills & Philosophy
### Building a Second Brain
[[Reading/Building a Second Brain|Building a Second Brain]] by Tiago Forte. This book presents a set of low-level tactics that helped me streamline my management of knowledge, tasks and goals.
- You should make a digital personal knowledge management system that is production-focused where insights you capture and distil are readily discoverable and exploitable.
- Attention and time are your most valuable assets. A second brain prepares you to focus and execute, knowing all your research is done and can be leveraged at a whim.
- Start *producing* things in addition to consuming things.

### Never Split the Difference

### Deep Work
[[Reading/Deep Work|Deep Work]] by Cal Newport.

### Ikigai
Ikigai by Francesc Miralles and Hector Garcia. 'Ikigai' means 'reason for being'.
- To live a meaningful work life, do: what you are *good* at, what you *love*, what the *world needs*, what you can be *paid* for. 
- Don't retire.
- Be a good friend and be well integrated in your community.

### Rich Dad Poor Dad
[[Reading/Rich Dad Poor Dad|Rich Dad Poor Dad]] by Robert Kiyosaki. This book made me more ruthlessly pursue learning and affirms the idea that investing in your own knowledge offers the greatest returns.
- Your knowledge is the greatest wealth vehicle, by far.
- Sales, marketing and negotiation are skills you must learn.
- Aim to aggressively acquire assets with each dollar you get and avoid liabilities as much as possible.
