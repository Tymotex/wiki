### Think Like a Programmer
[[Reading/Think Like a Programmer|Think Like a Programmer]] by Anton Spraul. I didn't complete this book since it wasn't introducing many new perspectives to problem-solving. Regardless, the takeaways from this book were helpful in validating what I learned through experience to be helpful in solving problems:
- Always start by articulating the problem in your own words, and write *precisely what the constraints are*.
- *Always have a plan* with intermediate goals.
- Stay alert for *analogies*, i.e. common patterns between the current problem and past problems.

## Self-Help, Skills & Philosophy
### Building a Second Brain
[[Reading/Building a Second Brain|Building a Second Brain]] by Tiago Forte. This book presents a set of low-level tactics that helped me streamline my management of knowledge, tasks and goals.
- You should make a digital personal knowledge management system that is production-focused where insights you capture and distil are readily discoverable and exploitable.
- Attention and time are your most valuable assets. A second brain prepares you to focus and execute, knowing all your research is done and can be leveraged at a whim.
- Start *producing* things in addition to consuming things.
