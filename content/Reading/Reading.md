TODO: this is a cool idea: https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries. Do 3 sentence summaries for each book that has made an impact on the way you think.
-   What are the main ideas? Eg. write down the 3-5 best ideas you sourced from the book.
-   If I implemented one idea from this book right now, which one would it be?
-   How would I describe the book to a friend?

TODO: this article is really worth re-reading: https://jamesclear.com/reading-comprehension-strategies.

**My favourite books**:
- Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.
- Deep Work by Cal Newport.

## Software Engineering
### Pragmatic Programmer
[[Reading/Pragmatic Programmer|Pragmatic Programmer]] by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas.

### Don't Make Me Think
[[Reading/Don't Make Me Think|Don't Make Me Think]] by Steve Krug.

### Refactoring UI

### Programming TypeScript

### Automate the Boring Stuff

### The Elements of Computing Systems

### The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide
(I only read ~30% of the book because most of the early chapters are targeted to newcomers to the industry.)

### Learning React

### Think Like a Programmer
[[Reading/Think Like a Programmer|Think Like a Programmer]] by Anton Spraul. I didn't complete this book since it wasn't introducing many new perspectives to problem-solving. Regardless, the takeaways from this book were helpful in validating what I learned through experience to be helpful in solving problems:
- Always start by articulating the problem in your own words, and write *precisely what the constraints are*.
- *Always have a plan* with intermediate goals.
- Stay alert for *analogies*, i.e. common patterns between the current problem and past problems.

## Biographies
### Man's Search For Meaning
[[Reading/Man's Search For Meaning|Man's Search For Meaning]] by Viktor E. Frankl. This book made me feel capable of having an unbreakable will in moments of extreme suffering and remaining stoic and sanguine independent of predicaments. The passages on Frankl describing his love for his wife made me cry hard.
- It is always possible to be a *good man* in the most hellish of conditions, and to have the strength of character to give away your last ration despite suffering extreme starvation.
- *Meaningful suffering* is integral to mental well-being.
- Love is the ultimate goal to aspire to. Work and love present the most fundamental sources of strength to draw upon when your resolve is tested.

> "He who has a *why* to live for can bear with almost any *how*" â€” Nietzsche.

## Self-Help, Skills & Philosophy
### Building a Second Brain
[[Reading/Building a Second Brain|Building a Second Brain]] by Tiago Forte. This book presents a set of low-level tactics that helped me streamline my management of knowledge, tasks and goals.
- You should make a digital personal knowledge management system that is production-focused where insights you capture and distil are readily discoverable and exploitable.
- Attention and time are your most valuable assets. A second brain prepares you to focus and execute, knowing all your research is done and can be leveraged at a whim.
- Start *producing* things in addition to consuming things.

### Millionaire Fastlane
[[Reading/Millionaire Fastlane|Millionaire Fastlane]] by MJ DeMarco.

### Never Split the Difference
[[Reading/Never Split the Difference|Never Split the Difference]] by Chris Voss.

### Deep Work
[[Reading/Deep Work|Deep Work]] by Cal Newport.

### Ikigai
Ikigai by Francesc Miralles and Hector Garcia. 'Ikigai' means 'reason for being'.
- To live a meaningful work life, do: what you are *good* at, what you *love*, what the *world needs*, what you can be *paid* for. 
- Don't retire.
- Be a good friend and be well integrated in your community.

### The Male Advantage
[[Reading/The Male Advantage|The Male Advantage]] by Kris Sturmey.

### The Simple Path to Wealth
[[Reading/The Simple Path to Wealth|The Simple Path to Wealth]] by J. L. Collins

### Barefoot Investor
[[Reading/Barefoot Investor|Barefoot Investor]] by Scott Pape.

### How to Not Die Alone
[[Reading/How to Not Die Alone|How to Not Die Alone]] by Logan Ury.

### The Defining Decade
[[Reading/The Defining Decade|The Defining Decade]] by Meg Jay.

### So Good They Can't Ignore You

### Atomic Habits

### How to Win Friends and Influence People

### Extreme Ownership

### Can't Hurt Me

### Rich Dad Poor Dad
[[Reading/Rich Dad Poor Dad|Rich Dad Poor Dad]] by Robert Kiyosaki. This book made me more ruthlessly pursue learning and affirms the idea that investing in your own knowledge offers the greatest returns.
- Your knowledge is the greatest wealth vehicle, by far.
- Sales, marketing and negotiation are skills you must learn.
- Aim to aggressively acquire assets with each dollar you get and avoid liabilities as much as possible.

> **The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind.** If it is trained well, it can create enormous wealth

## Science
### Why We Sleep
### Spark
[[Reading/Spark|Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain]] by John Ratey.

ðŸ’Ž Stress (which broadly, is any threat to your body's equilibrium) and recovery is necessary for building robust cells (therefore neurons).

Aerobic exercise leads to *neurogenesis* (the creation of new neurons), and when followed up by environmental stimulation, the new neurons are used to form new circuits.
> Gym class provides the brain with the right tools to learn, and the stimulation in the kids' classes encourages those newly developing cells to plug into the network, where they become valuable members of the signalling community.

> Learning and memory evolved in concert with the motor functions that allowed our ancestors to track down food, so as far as our brains are concerned, if we're not moving, there's no real need to learn anything.

Learning literally as you're exercising is ineffective because blood is directed away from your prefrontal cortex.
> While working out on the treadmill for twenty minutes at a high intensity of 70 to 80 percent of their maximum heart rate, college students perform poorly on tests of complex learning.

Exercise improves your cognitive flexibility, or in other words, your capacity to generate novel ideas.
> A notable experiment in 2007 showed that cognitive flexibility improves after just one 35 minute treadmill session at 70 percent of maximum heart rate... So if you have an important afternoon brainstorming session scheduled, going for a short, intense run during lunchtime is a smart idea.

> One small but scientifically sound study from Japan found that jogging thirty minutes just 2 or 3 times a week for twelve weeks improved executive function.

You should seek to combine aerobic activity and exercises involving complex motor skills in your exercise routine. Good examples include skill-based sports such rock climbing or figure skating or Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
> Greenough worked on an experiment several years ago in which running rats were compared to others that were taught complex motor skills, such as walking across balance beams, unstable objects, and elastic rope ladders. After 2 weeks of training, the acrobatic rats had a 35 percent increase of BDNF in the cerebellum, whereas the running rats had none in that area.

### Stress
> Stress and recovery. It's a fundamental paradigm of biology that has powerful and sometimes surprising results.

In the context of this book, stress is:
> ... a threat to the body's equilibrium... In the brain, *anything that causes cellular activity* *is a form of stress*. For a neuron to fire, it requires energy, and the process of burning fuel creates wear and tear on the cell.

> **Stress sparks brain growth**. Assuming that the stress is not too severe and that the neurons are given time to recover, the connections become stronger and our mental machinery works better. **Stress is not a matter of good and bad â€” it's a matter of necessity**.

An interesting experiment done by the US Department of Energy analysed the mortality rate of identical workers, some of which were exposed to a small amount of radiation. Paradoxically, the group exposed to radiation had a lower mortality rate, suggesting that their cells became resilient to the stresses imposed by the low radiation dosage.

> It seems that, like stress itself, cortisol isn't simply good or bad. A little bit helps wire in memories; too much suppresses them; and an overload can actually erode the connections between neurons and destroy memories.

> Two neurotransmitters put the brain on alert: **norepinephrine** arouses attention, then **dopamine** sharpens and focuses it.

> Even if we followed the most demanding governmental recommendations for exercise and logged thirty minutes of physical activity a day, we'd still be at less than half the energy expenditure for which our genes are encoded. Palaeolithic man had to walk five to ten miles on an average day, just to be able to eat.

> Studies show that by adding physical activity to our lives, we become more socially active â€”it boosts our confidence and provides an opportunity to meet people.

> If you exercise or even just socialise, you're tapping into the evolutionary antidote to stress.

> It's well known that the way to build muscles is to break them down and let them rest. The same paradigm applies to nerve cells, which have built-in repair and recovery mechanisms activated by mild stress.
