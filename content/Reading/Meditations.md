ðŸ’Ž It is irrational to hate people or vilify people for wrongdoing. They're people to sympathise with because they've forgotten or have never experienced the beauty in *goodness*.

ðŸ’Ž On a cosmic scale, you barely exist â€” that thought should trivialise your anxieties and griefs. Your only job is to be a *good man*.

ðŸ’Ž Seek mastery over your mind. If you can avoid being a puppet to pleasure or pain while having the mental fortitude required for being a *good man*, you will be happy.

ðŸ’Ž You don't control much of the world â€” often the only thing you do control is how you respond, and the correct ways to respond is with temperance, rationality, and compassion.

> Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option:
> - To accept this event with humility
> - To treat this person as he should be treated
> - To approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in.

> When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognised that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own â€” not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine.

> Remember how long you've been putting this off, how many extension the gods gave you, and you didn't use them. At some point you have to recognise what world it is that you belong to; what power rules it and from what source you spring; that there is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don't use it to free yourself it will be gone and will never return.

Stop and think about how incomprehensibly intricate and beautiful the world is. Even if all is lost is life, isn't this momentary existence in a such a mesmerising universe enough to be happy for?
> If you look at [things] in isolation there's nothing beautiful about them, and yet by supplementing nature they enrich it and draw us in. And anyone with a feeling for nature â€” a deeper sensitivity â€” will find it all gives pleasure.

> You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly everything self-important or malicious. You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, "What are you thinking about?" you can respond at once (and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that. And it would be obvious at once from your answer that your thoughts were straightforward and considerate ones â€” the thoughts of an unselfish person, one unconcerned with pleasure and with sensual indulgence generally, with squabbling, with slander and envy, or anything else you'd be ashamed to be caught thinking.

> Your ability to control your thoughts â€” treat it with respect. It's all that protects your mind from false perceptions â€” false to your nature, and that of all rational beings. It's what makes thoughtfulness possible, and affection for other people, and submission to the divine.

> If you do the job in a principled way, with diligence, energy and patience, if you keep yourself free of distractions, and keep the spirit inside you undamaged, as if you might have to give it back at any moment â€” If you can embrace this without fear or expectation â€” can find fulfillment in what you're doing now, as Nature intended, and in superhuman truthfulness (every word, every utterance) â€” then your life will be happy. No one can prevent that

> Or is it your reputation that's bothering you? But look at how soon we're all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us â€” how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space â€” and most ofit uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they are.

> That things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving, outside it. Disturbance comes only from within â€” from our own perceptions.
