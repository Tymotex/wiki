title: Meditations

ðŸ’Ž It is irrational to hate people or vilify people for wrongdoing. They're people to sympathise with because they've forgotten or have never experienced the beauty in *goodness*.

ðŸ’Ž On a cosmic scale, you barely exist â€” you are a conscious bit of matter suspended in a narrow slice of time, playing a rapidly forgotten role in the universe. That thought should trivialise your anxieties and griefs. Your only job in this world is to be a *good man* while you still have the capacity to reason.

ðŸ’Ž Seek mastery over your mind. If you can avoid being a puppet to pleasure or pain while having the mental fortitude required for being a *good man*, you will be happy.

ðŸ’Ž You don't control much of the world â€” often the only thing you do control is how you respond, and the correct ways to respond is with temperance, rationality, and compassion.

> Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option:
> - To accept this event with humility
> - To treat this person as he should be treated
> - To approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in.

> When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognised that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own â€” not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine.

> Remember how long you've been putting this off, how many extension the gods gave you, and you didn't use them. At some point you have to recognise what world it is that you belong to; what power rules it and from what source you spring; that there is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don't use it to free yourself it will be gone and will never return.

Stop and think about how incomprehensibly intricate and beautiful the world is. Even if all is lost is life, isn't this momentary existence in a such a mesmerising universe enough to be happy for?
> If you look at [things] in isolation there's nothing beautiful about them, and yet by supplementing nature they enrich it and draw us in. And anyone with a feeling for nature â€” a deeper sensitivity â€” will find it all gives pleasure.

> You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly everything self-important or malicious. You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, "What are you thinking about?" you can respond at once (and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that. And it would be obvious at once from your answer that your thoughts were straightforward and considerate ones â€” the thoughts of an unselfish person, one unconcerned with pleasure and with sensual indulgence generally, with squabbling, with slander and envy, or anything else you'd be ashamed to be caught thinking.

> Your ability to control your thoughts â€” treat it with respect. It's all that protects your mind from false perceptions â€” false to your nature, and that of all rational beings. It's what makes thoughtfulness possible, and affection for other people, and submission to the divine.

> If you do the job in a principled way, with diligence, energy and patience, if you keep yourself free of distractions, and keep the spirit inside you undamaged, as if you might have to give it back at any moment â€” If you can embrace this without fear or expectation â€” can find fulfillment in what you're doing now, as Nature intended, and in superhuman truthfulness (every word, every utterance) â€” then your life will be happy. No one can prevent that

> Or is it your reputation that's bothering you? But look at how soon we're all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us â€” how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space â€” and most ofit uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they are.

> That things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving, outside it. Disturbance comes only from within â€” from our own perceptions.

No one will remember you. All your mistakes and failures will be erased from history, given a bit of time. So will all your triumphs. Praise is near meaningless, it only serves to make you a little more comfortable while you're alive to receive it.
> People who are excited by posthumous fame forget that the people who remember them will soon die too. And those after the in turn. Until their memory, passed from one to another like a candle flame, gutters and goes out.
> But suppose that those who remembered you were immortal and your memory undying. What good would it do you? And I don't just mean when you're dead, but in your own lifetime. What use is praise, except to make your lifestyle a little more comfortable? 


> Beautiful things of any kind are beautiful in themselves and sufficient to themselves. **Praise is extraneous. The object of praise remains what it was â€” no better and no worse**. This applies, I think, even to "beautiful" things in ordinary life â€” physical objects, artworks. Does anything genuinely beautiful need supplementing? ... Are any of those improved by being praised? Or damaged by contempt? Is an emerald suddenly flawed if no one admires it? Or gold, or ivory, or purple? Lyres? Knives? Flowers? Bushes?

> "If you seek tranquility, do less." Or, more accurately, do what's essential... Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you'll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, "Is this necessary?"

This sounds exactly what the lovechild of Jocko Willink and Sam Harris would say. Free will doesn't exist and the obstacles you're going to face were pre-determined from the moment the particles settled into existence after the Big Bang. It's good to encounter these obstacles, they were instrumented into your unique existence and are there to test your character and leave you a better man than before. Always.
> Something happens to you. Good. It was meant for you by nature, woven into the pattern from the beginning.

> Nothing that goes on in anyone else's mind can harm you.

> In short, know this: Human lives are brief and trivial. yesterday a blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid, ash. To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it up without complaint. Like an olive that ripens and falls. Praising its mother, thanking the tree it grew on.

> So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.

> A trite but effective tactic against the fear of death: think of the list of people who had to be pried away from life. What did they gain by dying old?

> Consider the abyss of time past, the infinite future. Three days of life or three generations: what's the difference?

> At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: "I have to go to work â€” as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I'm going to do what I was born for â€” the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm? â€” But it's nicer here... So you were born to feel "nice"? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don't you see the plants, the birds, the ants, and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you're not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren't you running to do what your nature demands? ... You don't love yourself enough. Or you'd love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to eash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? When they're really possessed by what they do, they'd rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?


> Some people, when they do someone a favour, are always looking for a chance to call it in. And some aren't, but they're still aware of it â€” still regard it as a debt. But others don't even do that. They're like a vine that produces grapes without looking for anything in return.

> Not to feel exasperated, or defeated, or despondent because your days aren't packed with wise and moral actions. but to get back up when you fail, to celebrate behaving like a human â€” however imperfectly â€” and fully embrace the pursuit that you've embarked on.
 
> The things you think about determine the quality of your mind. Your soul takes on the colour of your thoughts. Colour it with a run of thoughts like [this]: Anywhere you can lead your life, you can lead a good one.

> Things have no hold on the soul. They have no access to it, cannot move or direct it. It is moved and directed by iself alone. It takes the things before it and interprets them as it sees fit.

> The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.

> Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone â€” those that are now, and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river: the "what" is in constant flux, the "why" has a thousand variations. Noting is stable, not even what's right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us â€” a chasm whose depths we cannot see. So it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or distress. Or any indignation, either. As if the things that irritate us lasted.

> So other people hurt me? That's their problem. Their character and actions are not mine. What is done to me is ordained by nature, what I do by my own.

> Soon you'll be ashes, or bones. A mere name, at most â€” and even that is just a sound, an echo.

> Then what is to be prized? An audience clapping? No. No more than the clacking of their tongues. Which is all that public praise amounts to â€” a clacking of tongues. So we throw out other people's recognition What's left for us to prize? I think it's this: to do (and not do) what we were designed for.

> Alexander the Great and his mule driver both died and the same thing happened to both. They were absorbed alike into the life force of the world, or dissolved alike into atoms.

> Disgraceful: for the soul to give up when the body is still going strong.

> Our lives are short. The only rewards of our existence here are an unstained character and unselfish acts.

> It's normal to feel pain in your hands and feet, if you're using your feet as feet and your hands as hands. And for a human being to feel stress is normal â€” if he's living a normal human life. And if it's normal, how can it be bad?

> Asia and Europe: distant recesses of the universe. The ocean: a drop of water. Mount Athos: a molehill. The present: a split second in eternity. Minuscule, transitory insignificant.

> You take things you don't control and define them as "good" or "bad." And so of course when the "bad" things happen, or the "good" ones don't, you blame the gods and feel hatred for the people responsible â€” or those you decide to make responsible. Much of our bad behaviour stems from trying to apply those criteria. If we limited "good" and "bad" to our own actions, we'd have no call to challenge God, or to treat other people as enemies.

> When you need encouragement, think of the qualities the people around you have: this one's energy, that one's modesty, another's generosity, and so on. Nothing is as encouraging as when virtues are visibly embodied in the people around us, when we're practically showered with them. It's good to keep this in mind.

> Evil: the same old thing. No matter what happens, keep this in mind: It's the same old thing, from one end of the world to the other. It fills the history books, ancient and modern, and the cities, and the houses too. Nothing new at all. Familiar, transient.

> Chronic pain is always endurable: the intelligence maintains serenity by cutting itself off from the body, the mind remains undiminished.

> And in most cases what Epicurus said should help: that pain is neither unbearable nor unending, as long as you keep in mind its limits and don't magnify them in your imagination.

> Perfection of character: to live your last day, every day, without frenzy, or sloth, or pretense.

 > If it's in your control, why do you do it? If it's in someone else's, then who are you blaming? Atoms? The gods? Stupid either way.

> Don't let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Don't try to picture everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with the situation at hand, and ask, "Why is this so unbearable? Why can't I endure it?" You'll be embarrassed to answer.

> Work: Not to rouse pity, not to win sympathy or admiration. Only this: Activity. Stillness. As the logos of the state requires.

> Enter their minds, and you'll find the judges you're so afraid of, and how judiciously they judge themselves>

> When we cease from activity, or follow a thought to its conclusion, it's a kind of death. And it doesn't harm us. Think about your life: childhood, boyhood, youth, old age. Every transformation a kind of dying. Was that so terrible?

> When you face someone's insults, hatred, whatever... look at his soul. Get inside him. Look at what sort of person he is. You'll find you don't need to strain to impress him.

> You can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind â€” things that exist only there â€” and clear out space for yourself: ... by comprehending the scale of the world... by contemplating infinite time... by thinking of the speed with which things change â€” each part of every thing; the narrow space between our birth and death; the infinite time before; the equally unbounded time that follows.

> What else did you expect from helping someone out? Isn't it enough that you've done what your nature demands? You want a salary for it too? As if your eyes expected a reward for seeing, or your feet for walking. That's what they were made for. By doing what they were designed to do, they're performing their function. Whereas humans were made to help others. And when we do help others â€” or help them to do something â€” we're doing what we were designed for. We perform our function.

> Whatever happens to you has been waiting to happen since the beginning of time. The twining strands of fate wove both of them together: your own existence and the things that happen to you.

> To stop talking about what the good man is like, and just be one.

> Continual awareness of all time and space, of the size and life span of the things around us. A grape seed in infinite space. A half twist of a corkscrew against eternity.

> When face with people's bad behaviour, turn around and ask when *you* have acted like that. When you saw money as a good, or pleasure, or social position. Your anger will subside as soon as you recognise that they acted under compulsion (what else could they do?).

> To be patient and cheerful with everyone, including them. Ready to show them their mistake. Not spitefully, or to show off my own self-control, but in an honest, upright way... That's what we should be like inside, and never let the gods catch us feeling anger or resentment.

> It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.

> ... that if you were suddenly lifted up and could see life and its variety from a vast height, and at the same time all the things around you, in the sky and beyond it, you'd see how pointless it is.
