ðŸ’Ž It is irrational to hate people or vilify people for wrongdoing. They're people to sympathise with because they've forgotten or have never experienced the beauty in *goodness*.

ðŸ’Ž On a cosmic scale, you barely exist â€” you are a conscious bit of matter suspended in a narrow slice of time, playing a rapidly forgotten role in the universe. That thought should trivialise your anxieties and griefs. Your only job in this world is to be a *good man* while you still have the capacity to reason.

ðŸ’Ž Seek mastery over your mind. If you can avoid being a puppet to pleasure or pain while having the mental fortitude required for being a *good man*, you will be happy.

ðŸ’Ž You don't control much of the world â€” often the only thing you do control is how you respond, and the correct ways to respond is with temperance, rationality, and compassion.

> Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option:
> - To accept this event with humility
> - To treat this person as he should be treated
> - To approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in.

> When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognised that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own â€” not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine.

> Remember how long you've been putting this off, how many extension the gods gave you, and you didn't use them. At some point you have to recognise what world it is that you belong to; what power rules it and from what source you spring; that there is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don't use it to free yourself it will be gone and will never return.

Stop and think about how incomprehensibly intricate and beautiful the world is. Even if all is lost is life, isn't this momentary existence in a such a mesmerising universe enough to be happy for?
> If you look at [things] in isolation there's nothing beautiful about them, and yet by supplementing nature they enrich it and draw us in. And anyone with a feeling for nature â€” a deeper sensitivity â€” will find it all gives pleasure.

> You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly everything self-important or malicious. You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, "What are you thinking about?" you can respond at once (and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that. And it would be obvious at once from your answer that your thoughts were straightforward and considerate ones â€” the thoughts of an unselfish person, one unconcerned with pleasure and with sensual indulgence generally, with squabbling, with slander and envy, or anything else you'd be ashamed to be caught thinking.

> Your ability to control your thoughts â€” treat it with respect. It's all that protects your mind from false perceptions â€” false to your nature, and that of all rational beings. It's what makes thoughtfulness possible, and affection for other people, and submission to the divine.

> If you do the job in a principled way, with diligence, energy and patience, if you keep yourself free of distractions, and keep the spirit inside you undamaged, as if you might have to give it back at any moment â€” If you can embrace this without fear or expectation â€” can find fulfillment in what you're doing now, as Nature intended, and in superhuman truthfulness (every word, every utterance) â€” then your life will be happy. No one can prevent that

> Or is it your reputation that's bothering you? But look at how soon we're all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us â€” how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space â€” and most ofit uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they are.

> That things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving, outside it. Disturbance comes only from within â€” from our own perceptions.

No one will remember you. All your mistakes and failures will be erased from history, given a bit of time. So will all your triumphs. Praise is near meaningless, it only serves to make you a little more comfortable while you're alive to receive it.
> People who are excited by posthumous fame forget that the people who remember them will soon die too. And those after the in turn. Until their memory, passed from one to another like a candle flame, gutters and goes out.
> But suppose that those who remembered you were immortal and your memory undying. What good would it do you? And I don't just mean when you're dead, but in your own lifetime. What use is praise, except to make your lifestyle a little more comfortable? 


> Beautiful things of any kind are beautiful in themselves and sufficient to themselves. **Praise is extraneous. The object of praise remains what it was â€” no better and no worse**. This applies, I think, even to "beautiful" things in ordinary life â€” physical objects, artworks. Does anything genuinely beautiful need supplementing? ... Are any of those improved by being praised? Or damaged by contempt? Is an emerald suddenly flawed if no one admires it? Or gold, or ivory, or purple? Lyres? Knives? Flowers? Bushes?

> "If you seek tranquility, do less." Or, more accurately, do what's essential... Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you'll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, "Is this necessary?"

This sounds exactly what the lovechild of Jocko Willink and Sam Harris would say. Free will doesn't exist and the obstacles you're going to face were pre-determined from the moment the particles settled into existence after the Big Bang. It's good to encounter these obstacles, they were instrumented into your unique existence and are there to test your character and leave you a better man than before. Always.
> Something happens to you. Good. It was meant for you by nature, woven into the pattern from the beginning.

> Nothing that goes on in anyone else's mind can harm you.

> In short, know this: Human lives are brief and trivial. yesterday a blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid, ash. To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it up without complaint. Like an olive that ripens and falls. Praising its mother, thanking the tree it grew on.

> So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.

> A trite but effective tactic against the fear of death: think of the list of people who had to be pried away from life. What did they gain by dying old?

> Consider the abyss of time past, the infinite future. Three days of life or three generations: what's the difference?

> At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: "I have to go to work â€” as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I'm going to do what I was born for â€” the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm? â€” But it's nicer here... So you were born to feel "nice"? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don't you see the plants, the birds, the ants, and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you're not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren't you running to do what your nature demands? ... You don't love yourself enough. Or you'd love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to eash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? When they're really possessed by what they do, they'd rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?


> Some people, when they do someone a favour, are always looking for a chance to call it in. And some aren't, but they're still aware of it â€” still regard it as a debt. But others don't even do that. They're like a vine that produces grapes without looking for anything in return.

> Not to feel exasperated, or defeated, or despondent because your days aren't packed with wise and moral actions. but to get back up when you fail, to celebrate behaving like a human â€” however imperfectly â€” and fully embrace the pursuit that you've embarked on.
 
> The things you think about determine the quality of your mind. Your soul takes on the colour of your thoughts. Colour it with a run of thoughts like [this]: Anywhere you can lead your life, you can lead a good one.

> Things have no hold on the soul. They have no access to it, cannot move or direct it. It is moved and directed by iself alone. It takes the things before it and interprets them as it sees fit.

> The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.

> Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone â€” those that are now, and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river: the "what" is in constant flux, the "why" has a thousand variations. Noting is stable, not even what's right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us â€” a chasm whose depths we cannot see. So it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or distress. Or any indignation, either. As if the things that irritate us lasted.

> So other people hurt me? That's their problem. Their character and actions are not mine. What is done to me is ordained by nature, what I do by my own.
