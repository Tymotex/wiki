title: Deep Work

> These ideas are sourced from Cal Newport's 'Deep Work' book, my personal observations about when I am most effective in complex technical endeavours and the blogs of some of the most effective software engineers out there.

*Deep work* sessions are long *uninterrupted* periods of time where you are able to "learn hard things fast and produce at an elite level".

TODO: Link context switching

Your output quantity/quality is simply $\text{Time spent} \times \text{Intensity of focus}$. Time is an incredibly scarce resource, so the main way to improve your output is to increase the intensity of focus.
- Avoid emails like the plague. Mute all email notifications, at least for the deep work sessions you schedule.
- Avoid context switching. This is incredibly deadly for software engineers where working on a project or fixing a bug requires you to hold so much information and context inside your brain's working memory (much like the volatile main memory of computer systems).
