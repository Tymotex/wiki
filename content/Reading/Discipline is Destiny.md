ðŸ’Ž We are always at Hercules' Crossroad. The path of suffering is reliably the better choice.

ðŸ’Ž Consistency is a superpower. Show up every day like your life depends on it and you'll have lucky breaks.

> "Two words should be taken to heart and obeyed when exerting ourselves for good and restraining ourselves from evil â€” words that will ensure a blameless and untroubled life: **persist and resist**." â€” Epictetus

The 4 cardinal virtues are *courage, temperance, justice* and *wisdom*. Temperance is self-discipline, which is about having command over yourself physically and mentally.

Courage is really only possible to exercise when you are fearful. Likewise, temperance is only possible to exercise when you have the freedom to choose otherwise. In modern life within developed nations, this freedom encompasses almost everything about your life. **You are always at [Hercules' crossroads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_at_the_crossroads)**.

The story of Lou Gehrig is inspiring. He just shows up, does his duty, and never lets anything derail him.
> The thing about Lou Gehrig is that he *chose* to be in control. This wasn't discipline enforced form above or by the team. His temperance was an interior force, emanating from deep within his soul. He chose it, despite teh sacrifices, despite the fact taht others allowed themselves to forgo such penance and got away with it. Despite the fact that it usually wasn't recognised â€” not until long after he was gone anyway... He was, a reporter would write, "unspoiled, without the remotest vestige of ego, vanity or conceit."

> The body, you must understand, is a metaphor. It's a training ground, a proving ground for the mind and the soul.

Just get up early. The time before the rest of the world start, before your obligations start piling in, is entirely yours to spend as you see fit. It's a moment where you have the calmest mind, greatest willpower and strongest resolve. Exploit it as much as possible.

Physical exercise should be a non-negotiable duty you attend to in your life. Theodore Roosevelt did it for hours daily during his presidency.
> Working out is in our control. It is a contained space in which the only potential obstacle is our determination and commitment.

Eisenhower on his lifetime smoking habit:
> "The only way to stop is to stop," [Eisenhower] would tell an aide, "and I stopped." No one "made him," â€” no one could â€” but he saw it as his duty to enforce it on himself.

When look at your bad habits, the habits themselves aren't necessarily destructive, it's the *dependency*. That's the source of suffering. So long as you're dependent on something to soothe your suffering, you'll never master your mind.

Always seek to make your place of work orderly. Clean your desk and desktop environment before you begin programming. Get all your weights stacked neatly before you begin powerlifting.

Learn to love the toil itself, not the fruits of labour.
> Always and forever, the reward is the work. It is a joy itself. It is torture and also heaven â€” sweaty, wonderful salvation. And that's how you manage to do prodigious amounts of it â€” not grudgingly, buy lovingly.

Constantly seek discomfort, like Seneca, who would commit to going days voluntarily living in poverty. Deny yourself luxuries if you don't want to be a slave to them. Temperance in times of plenty are when it really counts.
