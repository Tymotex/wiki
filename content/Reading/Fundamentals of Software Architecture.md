title: Fundamentals of Software Architecture
---

The software engineering ecosystem is constantly in flux as the result of new technologies, capabilities and changing assumptions. Because of this, there is **no definition** for what *software architecture* really is, because any definition falls out of pace with the rapidly changing ecosystem.

> Architects have an important responsibility to [continually] question assumptions and axioms left over from previous eras...
> All architectures are a product of their context.

Software architecture is defined by its:
1. **Structure**. Things like microservice/monolithic architecture, layered architecture, etc.
2. **Architecture characteristics**. Things like reliability, availability, scalability, fault tolerance, security, etc.
3. **Architecture decisions**. Such as the view not being able to talk directly to the database.
4. **Design principles**. The guidelines to follow, such as REST.

## Career
- You should ruthlessly seek to gain experience with different technologies. Your value scales better with breadth than depth.

> Leadership skills are at least half of what it takes to become an effective software architect.
