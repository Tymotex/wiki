The software engineering ecosystem is constantly in flux as the result of new technologies, capabilities and changing assumptions. Because of this, there is **no definition** for what *software architecture* really is, because any definition falls out of pace with the rapidly changing ecosystem. See [Martin Fowler's article on the trouble with defining architecture](https://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf). 

> Architects have an important responsibility to [continually] question assumptions and axioms left over from previous eras...
> All architectures are a product of their context.

Software architecture is defined by its:
1. **Structure**. Things like microservice/monolithic architecture, layered architecture, etc.
2. **Architecture characteristics**. Things like reliability, availability, scalability, fault tolerance, security, etc.
3. **Architecture decisions**. Such as the view not being able to talk directly to the database.
4. **Design principles**. The guidelines to follow, such as REST.

*Unknown unknowns* are the reason why having a big design up-front fails most of the time in software engineering, especially when compared to mature engineering disciplines like civil engineering. 
> *Unknown unknowns* are the nemesis of software systems. Many projects start with a list of *known unknowns*.

It's the unknown unknowns that *force* architectures to be iterative, hence the success of Agile.
> All architecture becomes iterative; it's only a matter of time.

## Career
- You should ruthlessly seek to gain experience with different technologies. Your value scales better with breadth than depth.
- You must learn leadership and negotiation skills.
    > Leadership skills are at least half of what it takes to become an effective software architect.
