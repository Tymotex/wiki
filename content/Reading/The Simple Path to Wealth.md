> Since money is the single most powerful tool we have for navigating this complex world we've created, understanding it is critical.

JL Collins advocates for just 3 things:
1. 50+% savings rate.
2. Avoiding debt.
3. Index funds.

> Stop thinking about what your money can buy. Start thinking about what your money can earn.

Think of your purchases in terms of opportunity cost. Using a sum of $1000 on gaming PC means that $1000 can no longer earn you an approximate 8% yearly return, meaning it costs future you in 10 years $1000 ⨉ 1.08^10 ≈ $2000.
> There is an opportunity cost to no longer having that money available to work for you.

> In owning VTSAX you are tying your financial future to that same large, diverse group of [more than 3000] companies based in the most powerful, wealthiest and most influential country on the planet. These companies are filled with hardworking people focused on prospering in the changing world around them and dealing with all the uncertainties it can create. 
> 
> These are companies filled with people working endlessly to expand and serve their customer base. They are competing in an unforgiving environment that rewards those who can make it happen and discards those who can't. It is this intense dynamic that makes stocks and the companies they represent the most powerful and successful investment class in history.
- Anytime one of the companies under VTSAX falls below a certain market cap, it is dropped from the list. They are then replaced by other firms, giving opportunity for new players to win big. JL Collins describes VTSAX as self-cleansing.
- There is also practically no upper bound on how much these companies win by.

Collins claims about the stock market, as learned over history:
- It is simply not possible to time the market (consistently).
    > The person who could reliably do this would be far richer than Warren Buffett, and twice as lionised.
    
    > Brad Barber of UC Davis and Terrance Odean of UC Berkeley found that **only about 1% of active traders outperform the market and that the more frequently they trade, the worse they do**.
    
    > "I've been in this business 61 years and I can't do it. I've never met anybody who can do it. I've never met anybody who's met anybody who can do it." — Jack Bogle.
- The market always goes up. It is just incredibly volatile in the short term, therefore requiring you to be mentally tougher at sticking to your strategy. 
    > Whether you invest today or sometime in the future, I guarantee your wealth will be cut in half more than once over those 60 years.
- The market always recovers, but expect constant large-scale disasters in the next decades.
    > And, if someday it really doesn't, no investment will be safe and none of this financial stuff will matter anyway... The trend is relentlessly, through disaster after disaster, up.
    
    > The next 10, 20, 30, 40 50 years will have just as many collapses, recessions and disasters as in the past.
- The stock market is the best performing asset class.
- Extremely few people, if any, can pick winning stocks. By extension, we cannot pick winning fund managers either.
    > Over periods of 15 to 30 years, the index will outperform 82% to 99% of actively managed funds.
    
> I don't favour indexing just because it is easier, although it is. Or because it is simpler, although it is that too. I favour it because it is more effective and more powerful in building wealth than the alternatives.

Safety does not exist in investing. Asset allocations towards bonds and cash exist to simply smooth the ride.
> There is no risk-free investment. Once you begin to accumulate wealth, risk is a fact of life. You can't avoid it, you only get to choose what kind.

Collins advocates for three tools to wealth accumulation and preservation:
1. VTSAX (Vanguard Total U.S. Stock Market Index Fund)
2. VBTLX (Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund)
3. VMMXX (Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund)




There is an endless amount of investment pathways available, but the main ones to focus on are low-cost index funds and broad-based stock index funds and broad-based bond index funds.

> "If you get a couple of things right, you can profoundly change your financial life without having to dwell on it, and you can get on with doing things that are more important to you and to the world."

Thinking that you can pick individual stocks and win. Yes, that's how Warren Buffett got rich, but the ability to do what he did is extraordinarily rare. Don't be full of yourself thinking you can pull the same thing off. The research shows that less than 1% of active funds outperform index funds over 30 years.

JL Collins doesn't like *dollar-cost averaging*. It's just delaying the risk according to him. 

Just put a substantial amount of your income into the market regularly. 

When the market drops, you should celebrate because you're getting more shares than otherwise. Selling should not be an option when your goal is to build wealth rather than *preserve* wealth.

> "Time in the market is more powerful than timing the market."
