TODO: you've got to emphasise the weekly task to clear out your todos. Make sure you're doing the things of greatest consequence. Never do more than n number of things a day.

> The average human lifespan is absurdly, terrifyingly, insultingly short. But that isn't a reason for unremitting despair, or for living in an anxiety-fueld panic about making the most of your limited time. it's a cause for relief. You get to give up on something that was always impossible — the quest to become the optimised, infinitely capable, emotionally invincible, fully independent person you're officially supposed to be. Then you get to roll up your sleeves and start work on what's gloriously possible instead.

> Time management is all life is.

We're always constantly shifting the goalpost forward with what we want out of life. We constantly "nominate new and better Joneses with whom to try to keep up" with.
> As a result, they work harder and harder, and soon **busyness becomes an emblem of prestige**. Which is clearly completely absurd: for almost the whole of history, the entire point of being rich was not having to work so much.

> "We labour at our daily work more ardently and thoughtlessly than is necessary to sustain our life." — Nietzsche.

Time should not be seen as separable from life. In other words, it is perverse to see time as a resource that you expend. Doing so denies you the opportunities to be present in your experiences:
> ... it makes it all but impossible to experience "deep time," that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead.

## Efficiency Trap
The natural solution we tend towards when life overwhelms us with things to do is to improve the rate we do them. The author argues that when we become more productive, we simply become even more overwhelmed with things to accomplish. The necessary compromise is to choose in advance what to fail at, and to make the painful decision to only focus on the things that *really* counts. This entails disappointing people and failing to live up to all the roles you wanted.
> Productivity is a trap. Becoming more efficient just makes you more rushed, and trying to clear the decks simply makes them fill up again faster.

In short, **the act of getting more things done condemns you to have more things to get done**.

There will never exist a time when you have everything under control — when your backlog of tasks is empty, when your emails have stopped being a pain, when you've become the perfect person you've envisioned yourself becoming.

Believing you can fit things in will naturally cause you to devote fewer resources to the most important and impactful things.
>The harder you struggle to fit everything in, **the more of your time you'll find yourself spending on the least meaningful things**... The reason for this effect is straightforward: the more firmly you believe it ought to be possible to find time for everything, the less pressure you'll feel to task whether any given activity is the best use for a portion of your time.

> One can waste years this way, systematically postponing precisely the things one cares about the most.

You must implement some kind of a filter to the things you aim to get done, otherwise the average meaningfulness of the work you do is decreased.
> If you never stop to ask yourself if the sacrifice is worth it, your days will automatically begin to fill not just with more things, but with more trivial or tedious things, because they've never had to clear the hurdle of being judged more important than something else.

Anytime you work on something, you forgo the time to work or do something else. You cast a subconscious vote that what you're doing now is more worthy of time and attention than anything else at the moment.
> **Every decision to use a portion of time on anything represents the sacrifice of all the other ways in which you could have spent that time, but didn't — and to willingly make that sacrifice is to take a stand, without reservation, on what matters most to you.**

Convenience culture is one manifestation of people falling into the efficiency trap. Eliminating things like grocery shopping, dishwashing, in-restaurant dining, and so on, does 'save you time', however it takes something essential from the experience of living. Moreover, the author argues that no time is really saved as the standards simply move up in response. E.g. when washing machines were invented, no time was saved because society's standards of cleanliness simply rose in response (a shifting of the goalpost), driving families to spend the same amount of time on other cleanliness-related chores, nullifying the time apparently saved.

Also, the argument of cutting time spent on laborious activities reminds me about games like *Stardew Valley*. The most joyous moments come when you allow yourself to slow down and let yourself be entirely present in its many tedious activities, such as farming, building social connections, decorating your farm, etc. Grinding gets you far fast, however... by the time you get there, haven't you missed the point?

An interesting observation of our behaviour is that we all tend to try to cram our lives with experience to quell the anxiety that we're not really living our insultingly finite life fully. The author argues that this is simply another instance of the efficiency trap, where the harder you try to do it, the more things there are to do.
> It's an attempt to devour the experiences the world has to offer, to feel like you've truly lived — but the world has an effectively infinite number of experiences to offer, so getting a handful of them under your belt brings you no close to a sense of having feasted on life's possibilities. Instead, you find yourself pitched straight back into the efficiency trap.,

The internet exacerbates this issue. We're constantly reminded of all the things we could be doing and we accumulate and infinite number of things that are worth our time and attention.
> Facebook, for example, is an extremely efficient way to stay informed about events you might like to attend. But it's also a guaranteed way to hear about more events you'd like to attend than anyone *possibly could* attend.

## Facing Finitude
Finitude itself can be the sole source of meaning for things. It is the fact that your relationships won't exist forever which compels you to cherish them. The fact that there is a last time to everything — the last time you hug your dad, the last time you pick up your child, the last time you take an exam — should instil gratitude in even the most mundane and forgettable experiences or most frustrating obligations in life.
> It's intrinsic to the value of this experience, he notes, that he won't be around to experience it forever, that his relatives won't either, that his relationships with his relatives are therefore temporary, too — and that even the coastline, in its current form, is a transient phenomenon, as dry land continues to emerge from the 12000-year retreat of the region's glaciers. If Hägglund were guaranteed an infinity of these summer vacations, there'd be nothing much to value about any one of them; **it's only the guarantee that he definitely won't have an infinity of them that makes them worth valuing**.

> This is the kernel of wisdom in the cliche of the celebrity who claims that a brush with cancer was "the best thing that ever happened" to them: it pitches them into a more authentic mode of being, in which everything suddenly feels more vividly meaningful.

> For instance, it's precisely the fact that getting married forecloses the possibility of meeting someone else — someone who might genuinely have been a better marriage partner; who could ever say? — that makes marriage meaningful.

> ... there's no possibility of a romantic relationship being truly fulfilling unless you're willing, at least for a while, to settle for that specific relationship, with all its imperfections — which means spurning the seductive lure of an infinite number of superior imaginary alternatives.

> [Sam] Harris' point is that we should therefore try to treat every such experience with the reverence we'd show if it were the final instance of it.

We forget how confounding it is that *anything* exists, let alone us. You did not do anything to deserve the right to exist. You just do. Isn't that enough reason to be grateful for the ride, regardless of how painful or miserable some of it is?
> I happen to be alive, and there's no cosmic law entitling me to that status. Being alive is just happenstance, and not one more day of it is guaranteed.

> But when you turn your attention instead to the fact that you're in a position to have an irritating experience in the first place, matters are liable to look very different indeed. All at once, it can seem amazing to be there at all, having any experience, in a way that's overwhelmingly more important than the fact that the experience happens to be an annoying one. Geoff Lye, a British environmental consultant, once told me that after the sudden and premature death of his friend and colleague David Watson, he would find himself stuck in traffic, not clenching his fists in agitation, as per usual, but wondering: "What would David have given to be caught in this traffic jam?"

## Becoming a Better Procrastinator
> The real measure of any time management technique is whether or not it helps you neglect the right things.

Limit the number of works in progress.
> Perhaps the most appealing way to resist the truth about your finite time is to initiate a large number of projects at once; that way, you get to feel as though you're keeping plenty of irons in the fire and making progress on all fronts. Instead, what usually ends up happening is that you make progress on no fronts — because each time a project starts to feel difficult, or frightening, or boring, you can bounce off to a different one instead. You get to preserve your sense of being in control of things, but at the cost of never finishing anything important.

> Buffett... tells the man to make a list of the top 25 things he wants out of life and then to arrange them in order, from the most important to the least. The top 5, Buffett says, should be those around which he organises his time. But contrary to what the pilot might have been expecting to hear, the remaining twenty, Buffett allegedly explains, aren't the second-tier priorities to which he should turn when he gets the chance. Far from it. In fact, **they're the ones he should actively avoid at all costs — because they're the ambitions insufficiently important to him to form the core of his life yet seductive enough to distract him from the ones that matter most**.

## Attention
Your entire life is just what you pay attention to.
> Your experience of being alive consists of nothing other than the sum of everything to which you pay attention.

> It's true that killing time on the internet often doesn't feel especially fun, these days. But it doesn't need to feel fun. **In order to dull the pain of finitude, it just needs to make you feel unconstrained**.

## Presence
Focusing on time corrupts the otherwise enriching experiences you have moment to moment. Having truly joyous moments becomes almost impossible when they all must serve some greater purpose of investment in the future.
> Inevitably, we become obsessed with "using [time] well," whereupon we discover an unfortunate truth: the more you focus on using time well, the more each day begins to feel like something you have to get through, en route to some calmer, better, more fulfilling point in the future, which never actually arrives.

The sad irony in the advice to just 'be more present' in life's experience is that it is done with an intent no different fundamentally to the mindset we're trying to escape — to get the most out of the time we have. When you take this mindset into 'being present', you fail to be present. The moment mustn't be treated as a means to an end, but the end in itself.
> The problem is that the effort to be present in the moment, though it seems like the exact opposite of the instrumentalist, future-focused mindset I've been criticising in this chapter, is in fact just a slightly different version of it. You're so fixated on trying to make the best use of your time — in this case not for some later outcome, but for an enriching experience of life right now — that it obscures the experience itself.

> **In order to most fully inhabit the only life you ever get, you have to refrain from using every spare hour for personal growth.**

> And so in order to be a source of true fulfilment, a good hobby probably should feel a little embarrassing; that's a sign you're doing it for its own sake, rather than for some socially sanctioned outcome.

## Patience
> ... speed addiction tends to be socially celebrated. Your friends are more likely to praise you for being "driven."

## Staying on the Bus
Like a game without quests or a complications in the storyline:
> ... a life devoid of all problems would contain nothing worth doing, and would therefore be meaningless.

> Once you give up on the unattainable goal of eradicating all your problems, it becomes possible to develop an appreciation for the fact that life just is a process of engaging with problem after problem, giving each one the time it requires — that **the presence of problems in your life, in other words, isn't an impediment to a meaningful existence but the very substance of one**.

> If you've decided to work on a given project for 50 minutes, the **once 50 minutes have elapsed, get up and walk away from it**. Why? Because as Boice explained, the urge to push onward beyond that point "includes a big component of impatience about not being finished, about not being productive enough, about never again finding such an ideal time" for work. **Stopping helps strengthen the muscle of patience that will permit you to return to the project again and again, and thus to sustain your productivity over an entire career.**

## Community
Interestingly, when people's vacation times overlap, people tend to be substantially happier during those times.
> In 2013, a researcher from Uppsala in Sweden elegantly proved the connection between synchronisation and life satisfaction when he had the ingenious notion of comparing Swedes' vacation patterns against statistics on the rate at which pharmacists dispensed antidepressants.

> ... synchrony is a portal to another dimension — to that sacred place where the boundaries of the self grow fuzzy, and time seems not to exist.

## Cosmic Insignificance Therapy
> When things all seem too much, what better solace than a reminder that they are, provided you're willing to zoom out a bit, indistinguishable from nothing at all? The anxieties that clutter the average life — relationship troubles, status rivalries, money worries — shrink instantly down to irrelevance. So do pandemics and presidencies, for that matter: the cosmos carries on regardless, calm and imperturbable.

> Pursuing the life projects that matter to you the most will almost always entail not feeling fully in control of your time, immune to the painful assaults of reality, or confident about the future. It means embarking on ventures that might fail, perhaps because you'll find you lacked sufficient talent; it means risking embarrassment, holding difficult conversations, disappointing others, and [so on...] is all but guaranteed.

## The Human Disease
> The more humane approach is to drop such efforts as completely as you can. Let your impossible standards crash to the ground. Then pick a few meaningful tasks from the rubble and **get started on them today**.

> It's easy to spend years treating your life as a dress rehearsal on the rationale that what you're doing, for the time being, is acquiring the skills and experience that will permit you to assume authoritative control of things later on.

> ... there is no institution, no walk of life, in which everyone isn't just winging it, all the time.

> It's alarming to face the prospect that you might never truly feel as though you know what you're doing, in work, marriage, parenting, or anything else. but it's liberating, too, because it removes a central reason for feeling self-conscious or inhibited about your performance in those domains in the present moment: if the feeling of total authority is never going to arrive, you might as well not wait any longer to give such activities your all — to put bold plans into practice, to stop erring on the side of caution.

An approach to life: always greedily do the next most important thing. Ignore everything else as you do it.
> ... if you do with conviction the next and most necessary thing, you are always doing something meaningful and intended by fate.

> ... **focus on one big project at a time (or at most, one work project and one nonwork project) and see it to completion before moving on to what's next**.

> ... whenever a generous impulse arises in your mind — to give money, check in on a friend, send an email praising someone's work — act on the impulse right away.
