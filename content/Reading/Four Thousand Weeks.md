title: Four Thousand Weeks
---

ðŸ’Ž Embrace finitude, it's what gives time and experience meaning and value. The fact that you exist is a cosmic miracle, and we always tend to forget that we had no right to exist, let alone to have things go our way all the time.

TODO: you've got to emphasise the weekly task to clear out your todos. Make sure you're doing the things of greatest consequence. Never do more than n number of things a day.

> Greece to the present day have taken the brevity of life to be the defining problem of human existence: **we've been granted the mental capacities to make almost infinitely ambitious plans, yet practically no time at all to put them into action**.

> Arguably, **time management is all life is**.

> Keynes was wrong. It turns out that when people make enough money to meet their needs, they just find new things to need and new lifestyles to aspire to; they never quite manage to keep up with the Joneses, because whenever they're in danger of getting close, they nominate new and better Joneses with whom to try to keep up. **As a result, they work harder and harder, and soon busyness becomes an emblem of prestige**. Which is clearly completely absurd: for almost the whole of history, the entire point of being rich was *not* having to work so much.

> Productivity is a trap. Becoming more efficient just makes you more rushed, and trying to clear the decks simply makes them fill up again faster.

> The day will never arrive when you have everything under control â€” when the flood of emails has been contained; when your to-do lists have stopped getting longer; when you're meeting all your obligations at work and in your home life; when nobody's angry with you for missing a deadline or dropping the ball; and when the fully optimised person you've become can turn, at long last, to the things life is really supposed to be about.

> Afterward, once "time" and "life" had been separated in most people's minds, time became a *thing* that you *used* â€” and it's this shift that serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today. Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, and to berate yourself when you feel you've wasted it.

> The fundamental problem is that this attitude toward time sets up a rigged game in which it's impossible ever to feel as though you're doing well enough.

> Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time â€” instead of just *being* time, you might say â€” it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally "out of the way..." But it ultimately backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out, experiencing everything in terms of some later, hope-for benefit, so that peace of mind never quite arrives. **And it makes it all but impossible to experience "deep time," that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting the abstract yardstick and plunging back into the vividness of reality instead**.

> "We labour at our daily work more ardently and thoughtlessly than is necessary to sustain our life," wrote Nietzsche.

> Since hard choices are unavoidable, what matters is learning to make them consciously, deciding what to focus on and what to neglect, rather than letting them get made by default â€” or deceiving yourself that, with enough hard work and the right time management tricks, you might not have to make them at all.

> Every decision to use a portion of time on anything represents the sacrifice of all the other ways in which you could have spent that time, but didn't â€” and to willingly make that sacrifice is to take a stand, without reservation, on what matters most to you.


## Efficiency Trap
You must make hard decisions to do what counts. This entails disappointing people, failing to live up to all the roles you wanted, ...

The efficiency trap is:
> Rendeirng yourself more efficient â€” either by implementing various productivity techniques or by driving yourself harder â€” won't generally result in the feeling of having "enough time," because, all else being equal, the demands will incrase to offset any benefits. Far from getting thigns done, you'll be creating new thigns to do.

The act of getting more things done condemns you to have more things to get done.

> We rarely stop to consider things so rationally, though, because that would mean confronting the painful truth of our limitations. WE would be forced to acknowledge that there are hard choices to be made: which balls to let drop, which people to disappoint, which cherished ambitions to abandon, which roles to fail at.

The goalpost keeps shifting.
> But the other exasperating issue is that if you succeed in fitting more in you'll find the goalposts start to shift: more things will begin to seem important, meaningful, or obligatory.

> "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion." â€” Parkinson's Law.

>The harder you struggle to fit everything in, the more of your time you'll find yourself spending on the least meaningful things... The reason for this effect is straightforward: the more firmly you believe it ought to be possible to find time for everything, the less pressure you'll feel to task whether any given activity is the best use for a portion of your time.

> If you never stop to ask yourself if the sacrifice is worth it, your days will automatically begint o fill not just with ore things, but with mroe trivial or tedious things, ebcause they've never had to clear the hurdel of ebeing judged more important than something else.

> One can waste years this way, systematically postponing precisely the things one cares about the most.

Convenience culture is one manifestation of people falling into the efficiency trap. Eliminating things like grocery shopping, dishwashing, in-restaurant dining, and so on, does 'save you time', however it takes something essential from the experience of living. As we know from the efficiency trap, you won't feel more on top of things for saving time on the tedious aspects of life. Think about games like *Stardew Valley*. The most joyous moments come when you slow down and let yourself be entirely present in some tedious but engaging thing, such as farming, talking to people, decorating, etc. Grinding gets you far fast, however... by the time you get there, have you missed the point?


'Settling' is an inevitability.

The quality of your attention is determines the quality of your experiences.
> "Attention is the beginning of devotion," writes the poet Mary Oliver... you can't truly love a partner or a child, dedicate yourself to a career â€” or to a cause or just savour the pleasure of a stroll in the park â€” except to the extent that you can hold your attention on the object of your devotion to begin with.

Burkeman argues that we give into distraction because it is deeply uncomfortable to face our finitude, of which is certain when we're dealing with anything we find meaningful, because it forces us to contend with the fact that we have limited power. As suggested in mindfulness meditation, you should not be fighting this discomfort. Instead, resolve to experience it fully. 

> We tend to think of [boredom] merely as a matter of not being particularly interested in whatever it is we're doing, but in fact it's an intense reaction to the deeply uncomfortable experience of confronting your limited control.

> It's true that killing time on the internet often doesn't feel especially *fun*, these days. But it doesn't need to feel fun. In order to dull the pain of finitude, it just needs to make you feel unconstrained.

Hofstadter's Law:
> It'll always take longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

The idea that you 'have' time is incorrect. You *expect* a certain amount of time. It is impossible to say with certainty how much time you'd need before getting to the airport, or whether you'll spend several more years with your family. Any kind of worrying is ultimately just desire for certainty, but:
> The struggle for certainty is an intrinsically hopeless one â€” which means you have permission to stop engaging in it.
