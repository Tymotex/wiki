TODO: you've got to emphasise the weekly task to clear out your todos. Make sure you're doing the things of greatest consequence. Never do more than n number of things a day.

> Time management is all life is.

We're always constantly shifting the goalpost forward with what we want out of life. We constantly "nominate new and better Joneses with whom to try to keep up" with.
> As a result, they work harder and harder, and soon **busyness becomes an emblem of prestige**. Which is clearly completely absurd: for almost the whole of history, the entire point of being rich was not having to work so much.

## Efficiency Trap
The natural solution we tend towards when life overwhelms us with things to do is to improve the rate we do them. The author argues that when we become more productive, we simply become even more overwhelmed with things to accomplish. The necessary compromise is to choose in advance what to fail at, and to make the painful decision to only focus on the things that *really* counts. This entails disappointing people and failing to live up to all the roles you wanted.
> Productivity is a trap. Becoming more efficient just makes you more rushed, and trying to clear the decks simply makes them fill up again faster.

In short, **the act of getting more things done condemns you to have more things to get done**.

There will never exist a time when you have everything under control â€” when your backlog of tasks is empty, when your emails have stopped being a pain, when you've become the perfect person you've envisioned yourself becoming.

>The harder you struggle to fit everything in, the more of your time you'll find yourself spending on the least meaningful things... The reason for this effect is straightforward: the more firmly you believe it ought to be possible to find time for everything, the less pressure you'll feel to task whether any given activity is the best use for a portion of your time.

> If you never stop to ask yourself if the sacrifice is worth it, your days will automatically begin to fill not just with more things, but with more trivial or tedious things, because they've never had to clear the hurdle of being judged more important than something else.

> One can waste years this way, systematically postponing precisely the things one cares about the most.

Convenience culture is one manifestation of people falling into the efficiency trap. Eliminating things like grocery shopping, dishwashing, in-restaurant dining, and so on, does 'save you time', however it takes something essential from the experience of living. As we know from the efficiency trap, you won't feel more on top of things for saving time on the tedious aspects of life. Think about games like *Stardew Valley*. The most joyous moments come when you slow down and let yourself be entirely present in some tedious but engaging thing, such as farming, talking to people, decorating, etc. Grinding gets you far fast, however... by the time you get there, have you missed the point?
