## Efficiency Trap
You must make hard decisions to do what counts. This entails disappointing people, failing to live up to all the roles you wanted, ...

The act of getting more things done condemns you to have more things to get done.

>The harder you struggle to fit everything in, the more of your time you'll find yourself spending on the least meaningful things... The reason for this effect is straightforward: the more firmly you believe it ought to be possible to find time for everything, the less pressure you'll feel to task whether any given activity is the best use for a portion of your time.

> If you never stop to ask yourself if the sacrifice is worth it, your days will automatically begint o fill not just with ore things, but with mroe trivial or tedious things, ebcause they've never had to clear the hurdel of ebeing judged more important than something else.

> One can waste years this way, systematically postponing precisely the things one cares about the most.

Convenience culture is one manifestation of people falling into the efficiency trap. Eliminating things like grocery shopping, dishwashing, in-restaurant dining, and so on, does 'save you time', however it takes something essential from the experience of living. As we know from the efficiency trap, you won't feel more on top of things for saving time on the tedious aspects of life. Think about games like *Stardew Valley*. The most joyous moments come when you slow down and let yourself be entirely present in some tedious but engaging thing, such as farming, talking to people, decorating, etc. Grinding gets you far fast, however... by the time you get there, have you missed the point?
