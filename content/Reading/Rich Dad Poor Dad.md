The main takeaway for me is that *you must be financially literate* and ruthlessly invest in your knowledge. This means being bold and learning things that you dislike or are fearful of such as sales, negotiation, public speaking, leadership, etc. This book gave me confidence the idea that my knowledge (or time and attention, two expensive inputs to attaining knowledge) is the greatest asset I possess. Constantly look and read about new approaches to investing that you've never considered or have much knowledge in.

ðŸ’Ž Aggressively collect assets and minimise accruing liabilities.

ðŸ’Ž Your knowledge is the greatest wealth vehicle. It offers the greatest returns out of all other possible investment options. You must constantly learn things and get better at learning itself.

ðŸ’Ž Always strive to learn *a little about a lot*. You must constantly pick up new skills, especially in areas that frighten you such as sales and public speaking.

ðŸ’Ž Sales, marketing and negotiation are skills you can't afford to suck at if you want the most out of life.

ðŸ’Ž Find personal heroes and learn and be inspired by the way they think.

## Knowledge
You *must* be financially literate (and disciplined). It is pointless to be rich and not understand the differences between assets and liabilities.
> Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is **financial education**. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth.

Remember the opportunity cost of using your money to buy some good or service. That money is no longer being used for growth. Some good or service may cost $100 today, but when factoring in its growth potential when put into an index fund or some other investment vehicle that good or service really would have costed you $200 ten years from now. You should see money as something that works for you, that is, an asset.
> The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.

> Think of it this way: Once a dollar goes into your asset column, it becomes your employee.

To be rich, spend on assets, minimise spending on liabilities. That's it. Assets include stocks, bonds, real estate, notes, and any other revenue-generating thing.
> Rule #1: You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets.

A good start is to simply redirect more of your money towards things that are clearly assets.
> Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not liabilities.

The 4 pillars of 'financial IQ' are:
1. Accounting.
2. Investing.
3. Understanding markets.
4. Law (for exploiting tax advantages, especially as a corporation).

Many people are "one skill away from great wealth". 
> **The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind**. If it is trained well, it can create enormous wealth.

You must get over your fears and learn sales, marketing and negotiation. Lacking these skills is what's keeping you from enjoying life to the fullest.
> **The most important specialised skills are sales and marketing**. The ability to sell â€” to communicate to another human being, be it a customer, employee, boss, spouse, or child â€” is the base skill of personal success. **Communications skills such as writing, speaking, and negotiating are crucial to a life of success**.

> I know of no other skills to be more important than selling and marketing. The skills of selling and marketing are difficult for most people, primarily due to their fear of rejection.

Stop being afraid of rejection. Actively seek it, in fact, and you'll be hardened.
> Failure inspires winners. And failure defeats losers.

The most common form of laziness is "laziness by staying busy." 
> Many rich families lose their assets in the next generation simply because there was no one trained to be a good steward over their assets.

It's unacceptable to *not* invest in your knowledge. This is easily the most worthwhile thing to spend time and money on.
> Most people simply buy investments rather than first investing *in learning about investing*.

> I am always shocked at people who buy stocks or real estate, but never invest in their greatest asset, their mind.

Being skilful and knowledgeable alone is not sufficient. You must be ruthlessly learning and doing so at a rate that keeps pace with changes in the world.
> In today's fast-changing world, it's not so much what you know anymore that counts, because often what you know is old. **It is how fast you learn**. That skill is priceless.

Consider the Darwinian idea that "it is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent. It is the one most adaptable to change."

Kiyosaki notes that he regularly looks for multi-day seminars to attend and commits to going to a few of them each year.

### Heroes
You should have heroes that shape your identity in the way you want. For example, Kiyosaki mentions idolising people such as Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch.
> Copying or emulating heroes is true power learning.

> When I'm in the market or I'm negotiating a deal, I am subconsciously acting with the bravado of Trump. Or when analysing a trend, I look at it as though Warren Buffet were doing it. **By having heroes, we tap into a tremendous source of raw genius**.

> Find someone who has done what you want to do. Take them to lunch and ask them for tips and tricks of the trade.

## Fear and Greed
Fear and greed are the source of many of problems in wealth building and life in general. Fear drives you to never take meaningful risks, greed drives you to scale up consumption when you earn more money, which increases your dependence on your 9-5 job. Fear and greed drive the rat race vicious cycle. More money doesn't solve life's problems, or at worst it can make you worse off by exacerbating your problems.
> People's lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and greed.

> "Just know that it's fear that keeps most people working at a job: the fear of not paying their bills, the fear of being fired, the fear of not having enough money, and the fear of starting over."

> If you don't first handle fear and desire, and you get rich, you'll only be a highly paid slave.

It's impossible to detach completely from fear and greed. Instead, use it to drive a virtuous cycle rather than a vicious cycle. Use fear of mediocrity or of never having taken risks to drive you to take meaningful risks in your career trajectory. Use greed to selfishly build up your own knowledge and aggressively invest.
> We will always have emotions of fear and greed... it's imperative for you to use those emotions to your advantage, and for the long term to not let your emotions control your thinking.

Kiyosaki asserts that your primary residence is a liability, not an asset, unless it is an investment property that provides you with regular rental income.
> The greatest losses of all are those from missed opportunities. If all your money is tied up in your house, you may be forced to work harder because your money continues blowing out of the expense column, instead of adding to the asset column â€” the classic middle-class cash-flow pattern.

Prioritise accumulating assets. Aim to use that to pay for luxuries, like a home.
> When I want a bigger house, I first buy assets that will generate the cash flow to pay for the house.

Beware of *irrational exuberance*. Going the crowded route tends to be unreliable.
> I would say that one of the hardest things about wealth-building is to be true to yourself and to be willing to not go along with the crowd. This is because, in the market, it is usually the crowd that shows up late that is slaughtered. If a great deal is on the front page, it's too late in most instances. Look for a new deal.

An idea originating from *The Richest Man in Babylon* is 'paying yourself first'. This means then when you have the funds to choose to either spend the money on investments or paying the bills, you should spend the money on investments *first*. This takes discipline because there is pressure in avoiding paying bills late, but Kiyosaki argues that this drives you to be financially intelligent and come up with ways to make it work.

Always be a giving person. Recall in [[Reading/Man's Search For Meaning|Man's Search For Meaning]], the prisoners who were most resilient and likely to survive were the ones who gave away their last piece of bread.
> When he was short of money, he gave money to his church or to his favourite charity. If I could leave one single idea with you, it is that idea. **Whenever you feel short or in need of something, give what you want first and it will come back in buckets**. That is true for money, a smile, love, or friendship.
