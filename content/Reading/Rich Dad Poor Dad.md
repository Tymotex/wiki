The main takeaway for me is that *you must be financially literate* and invest regularly in your knowledge. Be bold and learn things that you dislike or are fearful of such as sales, negotiation, public speaking, leadership, etc. Collect assets and minimise accumulating liabilities and you'll be wealthy.

ðŸ’Ž **Wealth is not a measure of money**, but rather the capacity to enjoy life to the fullest. Put concretely, it can be interpreted as the number of days you can live if you were to completely cease working.

ðŸ’Ž Just collect assets and minimise accruing liabilities.

ðŸ’Ž Your knowledge is the greatest wealth vehicle.

ðŸ’Ž Always strive to learn a little about a lot, to constantly pick up new skills (especially in areas that frighten you such as sales and public speaking) and be bolder than everyone else.

TODO: You should go do something bold, eg. take a course in negotiation, go to Toastmasters, do *something* that scares you.

> Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial education. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth.

> The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.

> "Just know that it's fear that keeps most people working at a job: the fear of not paying their bills, the fear of being fired, the fear of not having enough money, and the fear of starting over."

> People's lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and greed.

> If you don't first handle fear and desire, and you get rich, you'll only be a highly paid slave.

> We will always have emotions of fear and greed... it's imperative for you to use those emotions to your advantage, and for the long term to not let your emotions control your thinking.

Fear and greed drive the vicious cycle known as the *rat race*. More money doesn't solve life's problems, and it can exacerbate it.

> Rule #1: You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets.

To be rich, spend on assets, minimise spending on liabilities. That's it. Assets include stocks, bonds, real estate, notes, and any other revenue-generating thing.

> Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not liabilities.

> Think of it this way: Once a dollar goes into your asset column, it becomes your employee.

> The greatest losses of all are those from missed opportunities. If all your money is tied up in your house, you may be forced to work harder because your money continues blowing out of the expense column, instead of adding to the asset column â€” the classic middle-class cash-flow pattern.

> When I want a bigger house, I first buy assets that will generate the cash flow to pay for the house.

The 4 pillars of 'financial IQ' are:
1. Accounting
2. Investing
3. Understanding markets
4. Law (for exploiting tax advantages, especially as a corporation).

Many people are "one skill away from great wealth". 

> The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind. If it is trained well, it can create enormous wealth.

> **The most important specialised skills are sales and marketing**. The ability to sell â€” to communicate to another human being, be it a customer, employee, boss, spouse, or child â€” is the base skill of personal success. **Communications skills such as writing, speaking, and negotiating are crucial to a life of success**.

> I know of no other skills to be more important than selling and marketing. The skills of selling and marketing are difficult for most people, primarily due to their fear of rejection.
