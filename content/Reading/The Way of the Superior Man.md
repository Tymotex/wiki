title: The Way of the Superior Man
---


You must challenge your friends and push them beyond the edge of comfort and mediocrity. They must be doing the same to you.
> Your close men friends should be willing to challenge your mediocrity by suggesting a concrete action you can perform that will pop you out of your rut, one way or the other. And you must be willing to offer the your brutal honesty, in the same way, if you are all to grow. Good friends should not tolerate mediocrity in one another.

> Without a conscious life-purpose a man is totally lost, drifting, adapting to events rather than creating events.
