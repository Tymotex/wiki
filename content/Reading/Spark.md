ðŸ’Ž Stress (which broadly, is any threat to your body's equilibrium) and recovery is necessary for building robust cells (therefore neurons).

ðŸ’Ž Exercise rebalances your neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and many, many others). It's a powerful antidote for the effects of emotional stress and mental ailments, even reversing the damages of chronic stress. It makes you bullet-proof against depression and anxiety.

ðŸ’ŽExercise causes an increase in BDNF levels.

Aerobic exercise leads to *neurogenesis* (the creation of new neurons), and when followed up by environmental stimulation, the new neurons are used to form new circuits.
> Gym class provides the brain with the right tools to learn, and the stimulation in the kids' classes encourages those newly developing cells to plug into the network, where they become valuable members of the signalling community.

> Learning and memory evolved in concert with the motor functions that allowed our ancestors to track down food, so as far as our brains are concerned, if we're not moving, there's no real need to learn anything.

Learning literally as you're exercising is ineffective because blood is directed away from your prefrontal cortex.
> While working out on the treadmill for twenty minutes at a high intensity of 70 to 80 percent of their maximum heart rate, college students perform poorly on tests of complex learning.

Exercise improves your cognitive flexibility, or in other words, your capacity to generate novel ideas.
> A notable experiment in 2007 showed that cognitive flexibility improves after just one 35 minute treadmill session at 70 percent of maximum heart rate... So if you have an important afternoon brainstorming session scheduled, going for a short, intense run during lunchtime is a smart idea.

> One small but scientifically sound study from Japan found that jogging thirty minutes just 2 or 3 times a week for twelve weeks improved executive function.

You should seek to combine aerobic activity and exercises involving complex motor skills in your exercise routine. Good examples include skill-based sports such rock climbing or figure skating or Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
> Greenough worked on an experiment several years ago in which running rats were compared to others that were taught complex motor skills, such as walking across balance beams, unstable objects, and elastic rope ladders. After 2 weeks of training, the acrobatic rats had a 35 percent increase of BDNF in the cerebellum, whereas the running rats had none in that area.

### Stress
> Stress and recovery. It's a fundamental paradigm of biology that has powerful and sometimes surprising results.

In the context of this book, stress is:
> ... a threat to the body's equilibrium... In the brain, *anything that causes cellular activity* *is a form of stress*. For a neuron to fire, it requires energy, and the process of burning fuel creates wear and tear on the cell.

> **Stress sparks brain growth**. Assuming that the stress is not too severe and that the neurons are given time to recover, the connections become stronger and our mental machinery works better. **Stress is not a matter of good and bad â€” it's a matter of necessity**.

An interesting experiment done by the US Department of Energy analysed the mortality rate of identical workers, some of which were exposed to a small amount of radiation. Paradoxically, the group exposed to radiation had a lower mortality rate, suggesting that their cells became resilient to the stresses imposed by the low radiation dosage.

> It seems that, like stress itself, cortisol isn't simply good or bad. A little bit helps wire in memories; too much suppresses them; and an overload can actually erode the connections between neurons and destroy memories.

> Two neurotransmitters put the brain on alert: **norepinephrine** arouses attention, then **dopamine** sharpens and focuses it.

> Even if we followed the most demanding governmental recommendations for exercise and logged thirty minutes of physical activity a day, we'd still be at less than half the energy expenditure for which our genes are encoded. Palaeolithic man had to walk five to ten miles on an average day, just to be able to eat.

> Studies show that by adding physical activity to our lives, we become more socially active â€” it boosts our confidence and provides an opportunity to meet people.

> If you exercise or even just socialise, you're tapping into the evolutionary antidote to stress.

> It's well known that the way to build muscles is to break them down and let them rest. The same paradigm applies to nerve cells, which have built-in repair and recovery mechanisms activated by mild stress.

> The paradox is that our wonderful ability to adapt and grow doesn't happen without stress â€” we can't have the good without a bit of the bad.

> At every level, from the microcellular to the psychological, exercise not only wards off the ill effects of chronic stress; it can also reverse them. Studies show that if researchers exercise rats that have been chronically stressed, that activity makes the hippocampus grow back to its pre-shriveled state.

> In 2004 researchers at Leeds metropolitan University in England found that **workers who used their company's gym were more productive and felt better able to handle their workloads**. Most of the 210 participants in the study took an aerobics class at lunchtime, for 45 minutes to an hour. They filled out questionnaires at the end of every workday about how well they interacted with colleagues, managed, their time, and met deadlines. Some 65% fared better in all three categories on days they exercised. **And they felt less fatigued in the afternoon**, despite expending energy at lunchtime.

> Just keep in mind that the more stress you have, the more your body needs to move to keep your brain running smoothly.

### Anxiety
> In 2004 a researcher named Joshua Broman-Fulks from the University of Southern Mississippi tested whether exercise would reduce anxiety sensitivity. He found 54 college students with generalised anxiety disorder who had elevated anxiety sensitivity scores and who exercises less than once a week. 

They were divided into two groups, one undergoing vigorous aerobic exercise almost everyday, and the other undergoing mild aerobic exercise almost everyday.
> Both regiments tended to reduce anxiety sensitivity, but rigorous exercise worked more quickly and effectively... The theory is that when we increase our heart rate and breathing in the context of exercise, we learn that these physical signs don't necessarily lead to an anxiety attack.

> Moving the body also triggers the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is the brain's major inhibitory neuro-transmitter (and the primary target for most of our antianxiety medicines). Having normal levels of GABA is crucial to stopping, at the cellular level, the self-fulfilling prophecy of anxiety â€” it interrupts the obsessive feedback loop within the brain.

> Living with panic means avoiding anything that might set off another frightening episode. You withdraw into an emotional fetal position, and the fear leads to a desperate need for control â€” whatever is necessary to maintaina a stable and safe environment. This manifests itself in various ways: passive-aggressiveness, which is one way of trying to control others; compulsiveness, to keep the fear triggers at bay; and overall inflexibility.

> **ANP [(atrial natriuretic peptide)] is secreted by heart muscles when we exercise**... ANP has been shown in both animal and human studies to have a calming effect... In 2001 one of the first studies to verify the role of ANP in anxiety compared patients with panic disorder to those without. They were randomly assigned an injection of ANP or placebo, and then received a dose of an abdominal hormone called cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4), which induces anxiety and panic. **ANP significantly reduced panic attacks in both groups while the placebo did not**.

> In one study of patients with severe heart failure, those with the highest ANP levels had the lowest levels of anxiety... And we know that among panic disorder patients, those who have frequent attacks have a deficit of ANP in their bloodstreams.

> In 2006... Strohle looked at twhether ANP was a critical element in the calming effect of aerobic exercise. For 10 healthy patients who agreed to have panic-inducing injections of CCK-4, walking for thirty minutes on a treadmill significantly increased concentrations of ANP while simultaneously lowering feelings of anxiety and panic.

Fear is burned deeply into memory and is challenging to reverse, however cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective way of suppressing it by progressively exposing patients to the source of the fear but reinforcing neutral/positive instead of negative associations with that fear.
> When we experience the symptoms without the panic, the brain goes through a cognitive restructuring. We build connections in the prefrontal cortex that help calm the amygdala, which makes us feel safe, and then the brain records a memory of that feeling. When we add in exercise, we get the neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors bolstering the circuits between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, providing further control and creating a positive snowball effect... Teaching the brain that we can survive is crucial to overcoming the anxiety.

> If you begin to associate the physical symptoms of anxiety with something positive, something that you initiated and can control, teh fear memory fades in contrast to the fresh one taking shape. Think of it as a biological bait and switch â€” your ind is expecting a panic attack, but instead it ends up with a positive association with the symptoms.

### Depression

> Endorphins... dulled pain in the body and produced euphoria in the mind. **They are the elixir of heroism**, helping us ignore pain when we're physically overextended so we can finish the task at hand.

> A massive Dutch study of 19288 twins and their families published in 2006 showed that **exercisers are less anxious, less depressed, less neurotic, and also more socially outgoing**.

> A Finnish study of 3,403 people in 1999 showed that those who exercise at least two to three times a week **experience significantly less depression, anger, stress, and "cynical distrust"** than those who exercise less or not at all.

> Aside from elevating endorphins, exercise regulates all of the neurotransmitters targeted by antidepressants.

Exercise is said to immediately increase levels of norepinephrine, boost dopamine (which is "all about motivation and attention"), and boost serotonin which is critical to impulse control, self-esteem and counteracting cortisol.
> Studies have shown that chronic **exercise increases dopamine storage in the brain and also triggers the production of enzymes that create dopamine receptors in the reward center of the brains**... If the demand is there, the dopamine genes get activated to produce more, and the overall effect is a more stable regulation of these pathways which are important to controlling addictions.

> ... They randomly divided 156 patients into 3 groups: Zolofy, exercise, or a combination of the two. The exercise group was assigned to supervised walking or jogging, at 70-85% of their aerobic capacity, for 30 minutes three times a week. The results? All 3 groups showed a significant drop in depression, and about half of each group was completely out of the woods. Another 13% experienced fewer symptoms but didn't fully recover. Blumenthal concluded that **exercise was as effective as medication**... 6 months after the study, Blumenthal and his colleagues surveyed the patients to see how they were doing and found that exercise worked even better than medicine over the long term. About 30% of the exercise group remained depressed vs. 52% of those on medication and 55% for those in the combined treatment group [(the explanation for this unexpected result in the combined group is that "instead of incorporating the belief 'I was dedicated and worked hard with the exercise program; it wasn't easy, but I beat this depression,' patients might incorporate the belief 'I took an antidepressant and got better.'")].

> In post-mortem studies of people with depression who died of suicide, their brains had significantly decreased levels of BDNF. Evn in healthy people, low BDNF levels have been correlated with personality traits that make them more vulnerable to depression, such as neuroticism and hostility.

> [Exercise] doesn't simply raise serotonin or dopamine or norepinephrine. It adjusts all of them, to levels that, we can only presume, have been optimally programmed by evolution. The same goes for exercise's effect on BDNF, IGF-1, VEGF, and FGF-2, which provide the building material and oversight for the construction of new connections and neurons.

### Attention
> The attention circuits are jointly regulated by the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine, which are so similar on a molecular level that they can plug into each others' receptors. These are the chemicals targeted by ADHD medications.
