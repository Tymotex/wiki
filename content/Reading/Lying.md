title: Lying
---

ðŸ’Ž Obey the precept uncompromisingly: **never tell lies**.

ðŸ’Ž White lies, when unpacked, are never the compassionate option. Telling a white lie denies the person their autonomy to act on true information and is a failure of friendship. Be tactful where possible, but never use compassionate deceit as a moral justification.

ðŸ’Ž Your honesty, and reputation for it, makes everything you say much more meaningful to people. Your words are trusted and your praise is never mistaken to be flattery.

ðŸ’Ž Lies, however innocuous, require continual maintenance. Why not live, *knowing with every fibre of your being* that you have nothing to hide and therefore nothing complicate your connection with people?

> Among the many paradoxes of human life, this is perhaps the most peculiar and consequential: We often behave in ways that are guaranteed to make us unhappy. Many of us spend our lives marching with open eyes toward remorse, regret, guilt, and disappointment.

A distinction should be drawn between deception and lying.
> To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication.

> At least one study suggests that 10% of communication between spouses is deceptive. Another has found that 38% of encounters among college students contain lies... Research suggests that all forms of lying â€” including white lies meant to spare the feelings of others â€” are associated with poorer-quality relationships.

> Honest people are a refuge: You know they mean what they say; you know they will not say one thing to your face and another behind your back; you know they will tell you when they think you have failed â€” and for this reason their praise cannot be mistaken for mere flattery.

> To do this is also to hold a mirror up to one's life â€” because a commitment to telling the truth requires that one pay attention to what the truth is in every moment. What sort of person are you? How judgemental, self-interested, or petty have you become? You might discover that some of your friendships are not really that â€” perhaps you habitually lie to avoid making plans, or fail to express your true opinions for fear of conflict. Whom, exactly, are you helping by living this way? You might find that certain relationships cannot be honestly maintained.

> Sincerity, authenticity, integrity, mutual understanding â€” these and other sources of moral wealth are destroyed the moment we deliberately misrepresent our beliefs, whether or not our lies are ever discovered.

> While we imagine that we tell certain lies out of compassion for others, it is rarely difficult to spot the damage we do in the process. By lying, we deny our friends access to reality â€” and their resulting ignorance often harms them in ways we did not anticipate. Our friends may act on our falsehoods, or fail to solve problems that could have been solved only on the basis of good information. Rather often, to lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about.

> A white lie is simply a denial of these realities. It is a refusal to offer honest guidance in a storm. Even on so touchy a subject, lying seems a clear failure of friendship.

> Failures of personal integrity, once revealed, are rarely forgotten. We can apologise, of course. And we can resolve to be more forthright in the future. But we cannot erase the bad impression we have left in the minds of other people.

> I continue to find that a willingness to be honest â€” especially about truths that one might be expected to conceal â€” often leads to much more gratifying exchanges with other human beings.

> Lying is, almost by definition, a refusal to cooperate with others.

> How would your relationships change if you resolved never to lie again? What truths might suddenly come into view in your life? What kind of person would you become? And how might you change the peoples around you? It is worth finding out.
