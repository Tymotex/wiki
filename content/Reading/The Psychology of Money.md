### No One is Crazy
> Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.

Everyone has their own idiosyncratic relationship with money, but they're all shaped by incredibly unique sets of circumstances and observations. Firmly held beliefs in one reasonable person can be totally at odds with beliefs in another reasonable person.

### Luck and Risk
Luck and risk (misfortune) are fundamental forces polarising people towards wild success and catastrophic failure. Detach from your ego and realise that luck played a massive role in your personal successes, and risk played a massive role in your failings. 

The book discusses Bill Gates as an example and Paul Allen, the founders of Microsoft. They attended a high school which was one of the only in the world that access to a computer in the 1960s. Of the ~300 million people of comparable age in existence at the time, you'd need to win a 1-in-a-million dice roll to have gone to this high school. There was also a third person, Kent Evans, who was a close friend with Gates and Allen, and equally ambitious and obsessed with the possibilities of modern computer, but who died to a mountaineering accident before graduating high school, another 1-in-a-million dice roll.

Emulating the decision-making of wildly successful people and expecting the same level of outcome is unreasonable.

> "One lucky break, or one supremely shrewd decision â€” can we tell them apart?" â€” Benjamin Graham, reflecting on his GEICO stock which violated the principles he wrote about in the Intelligent Investor, but which won him a huge fortune.

> The line between 'inspiringly bold' and 'foolishly reckless' can be a millimeter thick and only visible with hindsight.

In many cases, it is impossible to distinguish between luck and misfortune. **Never judge people for the way they are and things they've achieved**.

> **Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.**

> Therefore, **focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns**.

You can't fully attribute personal successes to inputs that you controlled â€” such as hard work, ambition and education. These are necessary inputs, but know that your outcomes are a complex function of luck.
> When things are going extremely well, realise it's not as good as you think. You are not invincible, and if you acknowledge that luck brought you success then **you have to believe in luck's cousin, risk, which can turn your story around just as quickly**.

### Never Enough
Greed is insatiable.
> There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you *don't have* and *don't need*.

> **The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.**

> ... **the ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it**. Which means it's a battle that can never be won, or that the only way to win is to not fight to begin with â€” to accept that you might have enough, even if it's less than those around you.

### Confounding Compounding
> $81.5 billion of Warren Buffett's $84.5 billion net worth came *after his 65th birthday*. Our minds are not built to handle such absurdities.

> If something compounds â€” if a little growth serves as the fuel for future growth â€” **a small starting base can lead to results so extraordinary they seem to defy logic**. It can be so logic-defying that you underestimate what's possible, where growth comes from, and what it can lead to.

> Warren Buffett is a phenomenal investor. But you miss a key point if you attach all of his success to investing acumen. **The real key to his success is that he's been a phenomenal investor for 3 quarters of a century**.

> There are books on economic cycles, trading strategies, and sector bets. But the most powerful and important book should be called Shut Up and Wait. It's just one page with a long-term chart of economic growth.

> You can't blame people for devoting all their effort â€” effort in what they learn and what they do â€” to trying to earn the highest investment returns. It intuitively seems like the best way to get rich. But good investing isn't necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can't be repeated. It's about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. That's when compounding runs wild.

### Staying Wealthy
> There's only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia.

Morgan stresses the mental cue of 'survival' as being the primary aspect determining whether people can maintain wealth. Basically be optimistic for the future, but paranoid about what will the curveballs along the way.

> Compounding doesn't rely on earning big returns. Merely good returns sustained uninterrupted for the longest period of time â€” especially in times of chaos and havoc â€” will always win.

Few plans survive first encounter with reality. Having room for error in your financial plan, also called *margin of safety*, keeps you in the game.

### Tails
This chapter discusses the phenomena of value being concentrated in a small percentage of things in a set of many things. For example, Amazon's main money makers are AWS and Prime, but they've had huge product launch failures. Morgan endorses index investing, which is works over the long-term because it always captures those companies that are astronomical successes.

> Your success as an investor will be determined by how you respond to punctuated moments of terror, not the years spent on cruise control.

In other words, if you just have the discipline to stick to index investing irrespective of headlines, recessions and catastrophes, you'll win.

When analysing the success of individuals and companies, most of it comes from a small percentage of 'correct' decisions. The rest are a mix of average to poor decisions.
