### No One is Crazy
> Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.

Everyone has their own idiosyncratic relationship with money, but they're all shaped by incredibly unique sets of circumstances and observations. Firmly held beliefs in one reasonable person can be totally at odds with beliefs in another reasonable person.

### Luck and Risk
Luck and risk (misfortune) are fundamental forces polarising people towards wild success and catastrophic failure. Detach from your ego and realise that luck played a massive role in your personal successes, and risk played a massive role in your failings. 

The book discusses Bill Gates as an example and Paul Allen, the founders of Microsoft. They attended a high school which was one of the only in the world that access to a computer in the 1960s. Of the ~300 million people of comparable age in existence at the time, you'd need to win a 1-in-a-million dice roll to have gone to this high school. There was also a third person, Kent Evans, who was a close friend with Gates and Allen, and equally ambitious and obsessed with the possibilities of modern computer, but who died to a mountaineering accident before graduating high school, another 1-in-a-million dice roll.

Emulating the decision-making of wildly successful people and expecting the same level of outcome is unreasonable.

> "One lucky break, or one supremely shrewd decision — can we tell them apart?" — Benjamin Graham, reflecting on his GEICO stock which violated the principles he wrote about in the Intelligent Investor, but which won him a huge fortune.

> The line between 'inspiringly bold' and 'foolishly reckless' can be a millimeter thick and only visible with hindsight.

In many cases, it is impossible to distinguish between luck and misfortune. **Never judge people for the way they are and things they've achieved**.

> **Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.**

> Therefore, **focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns**.

You can't fully attribute personal successes to inputs that you controlled — such as hard work, ambition and education. These are necessary inputs, but know that your outcomes are a complex function of luck.
> When things are going extremely well, realise it's not as good as you think. You are not invincible, and if you acknowledge that luck brought you success then **you have to believe in luck's cousin, risk, which can turn your story around just as quickly**.

### Never Enough
Greed is insatiable.
> There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you *don't have* and *don't need*.

> **The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.**

> ... **the ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it**. Which means it's a battle that can never be won, or that the only way to win is to not fight to begin with — to accept that you might have enough, even if it's less than those around you.

### Confounding Compounding
> $81.5 billion of Warren Buffett's $84.5 billion net worth came *after his 65th birthday*. Our minds are not built to handle such absurdities.

> If something compounds — if a little growth serves as the fuel for future growth — **a small starting base can lead to results so extraordinary they seem to defy logic**. It can be so logic-defying that you underestimate what's possible, where growth comes from, and what it can lead to.

> Warren Buffett is a phenomenal investor. But you miss a key point if you attach all of his success to investing acumen. **The real key to his success is that he's been a phenomenal investor for 3 quarters of a century**.

> There are books on economic cycles, trading strategies, and sector bets. But the most powerful and important book should be called Shut Up and Wait. It's just one page with a long-term chart of economic growth.

> You can't blame people for devoting all their effort — effort in what they learn and what they do — to trying to earn the highest investment returns. It intuitively seems like the best way to get rich. But good investing isn't necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can't be repeated. It's about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. That's when compounding runs wild.

### Staying Wealthy
> There's only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia.

Morgan stresses the mental cue of 'survival' as being the primary aspect determining whether people can maintain wealth. Basically be optimistic for the future, but paranoid about what will the curveballs along the way.

> Compounding doesn't rely on earning big returns. Merely good returns sustained uninterrupted for the longest period of time — especially in times of chaos and havoc — will always win.

Few plans survive first encounter with reality. Having room for error in your financial plan, also called *margin of safety*, keeps you in the game.

### Tails
This chapter discusses the phenomena of value being concentrated in a small percentage of things in a set of many things. For example, Amazon's main money makers are AWS and Prime, but they've had huge product launch failures. Morgan endorses index investing, which is works over the long-term because it always captures those companies that are astronomical successes.

> Your success as an investor will be determined by how you respond to punctuated moments of terror, not the years spent on cruise control.

In other words, if you just have the discipline to stick to index investing irrespective of headlines, recessions and catastrophes, you'll win.

When analysing the success of individuals and companies, most of it comes from a small percentage of 'correct' decisions. The rest are a mix of average to poor decisions.

### Freedom
>**The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, "I can do whatever I want today."**

One of the most reliable predictors of happiness is having a real sense of autonomy. When framed this way, the function of money is really to **grant you autonomy over your time**.
> Having a strong sense of controlling one's life is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered.

> Using your money to buy time and options has a lifestyle benefit few luxury goods can compete with.

> ... doing something you love on a schedule you can't control can feel the same as doing something you hate.

Recall the 'Monk and the Minister' parable discussed in [[Reading/The Simple Path to Wealth|The Simple Path to Wealth]]:
> Two close boyhood friends grow up and go their separate ways. One becomes a humble monk, the other a rich and powerful minister to the king. Years later they meet. As they catch up, the portly minister (in his fine robes) takes pity on the thin and shabby monk. Seeking to help, he says: “You know, if you could learn to cater to the king, you wouldn’t have to live on rice and beans.” To which the monk replies: “If you could learn to live on rice and beans, you wouldn’t have to cater to the king.”

### Man-in-the-Car Paradox
> No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are.

You're never actually thinking about how great the person owning some luxurious possession is, you're subconsciously visualising how great it'd be to be in their position.

A common idea propagated by the self-help community is that one should never be worried what others think, because they're too busy worrying about what others think of them. A similar sentiment applies to materialism:
> There is a paradox here: people tend to want wealth to signal to others that they should be liked and admired. But in reality those other people often bypass admiring you, not because they don't think wealth is admirable, but because they use your wealth as a benchmark for their own desire to be liked and admired.

Get out of your head, no one is thinking about you and no one will really commend you for being wealthy. They'll remember you for your contributions to something greater than yourself, and for your virtues and kindness to others.

> If respect and admiration are your goal, be careful how you seek it. Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will.

### Wealth is What You Don't See
> Wealth is the nice cars not purchased. The diamonds not bought. The watches not worn, the clothes forgone and the first-class upgrade declined. Wealth is financial assets that haven't yet been converted into the stuff you see.

Money that you don't spend is money that continues to compound and bolster the security that grants you freedom, which is really the backbone of happiness. Don't associate heavy spending with high wealth in your superficial assessments of the people around you. Spending money to acquire status-boosting possessions actively destroys the wealth you're trying to build. 
> **The world is filled with people who look modest but are actually wealthy** and people who look rich who live at the razor's edge of insolvency. Keep this in mind when quickly judging others' success and setting your own goals.

### Save Money
> The only factor you can control generates one of the only things that matters. How wonderful.

Increasing your savings rate is the easiest opportunity to exploit to expand wealth. Despite this, most people see raising personal income as the main way to expand wealth. It's true of course, but learning to live with less is liberating, and leaves you with more money to compound and carry you to the summit faster.

> Building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate.

> There are professional investors who grind 80 hours a week to add 0.1% to their returns when there are 2 or 3 full percentage points of lifestyle bloat in their finances that can be exploited with less effort.

*Ego is the enemy*. Don't associate our status or worth with your capacity for spending money.
> One of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn't to raise your income. It's to **raise your humility**.

> People with enduring personal finance success — not necessarily those with high incomes — tend to have a propensity to not give a damn what others think about them.

Money can acquire concrete things, and the saving of money may seem like deprivation, however saving can in fact buy you
> ... the ability to wait and the opportunity to pounce. It gives you time to think. It lets you change course on your own terms.

> Every bit of savings is like taking a point in the future that would have been owned by someone else and giving it back to yourself. That flexibility and control over your time is an unseen return on wealth.

A savings account with a 0% interest rate (or even negative interest rate) might be one of the best investments in your portfolio just because it buys you flexibility in life.

### Reasonable > Rational
> Aiming to be mostly reasonable works better than trying to be coldly rational.

> In 2008 a pair of researchers from Yale published a study arguing young savers should supercharge their retirement accounts using 2-to-1 margin (two dollars of debt for every dollar of their own money) when buying stocks. It suggests investors taper that leverage as they age, which lets a saver take more risk when they're young and can handle a magnified market rollercoaster, and less when they're older. Even if using leverage left you wiped out when you were young (if you use 2-to-1 margin, a 50% market drop leaves you with nothing) the researchers showed savers would still be better off in long run so long as they picked themselves back up, followed the plan, and kept saving in a 2-to-1 leveraged account the day after being wiped out.

> It's almost a badge of honour for investors to claim they're emotionless about their investments, because it seems rational... The reasonable investors who love their technically imperfect strategies have an edge, because they're more likely to stick with those strategies.

This chapter is not an excuse to be less rational, or a way of discouraging rational and functional strategies. It's meant to stress that one of the most important variables in financial success is discipline, and being able to stick to an imperfect plan is much better than failing to stick to a perfect plan. This seems to be a important piece of wisdom in exercise routines - it doesn't really matter what exercise you do if you can't stick to the program.

### Surprise!
> Experiencing specific events does not necessarily qualify you to know what will happen next. In fact it rarely does, because experience leads to overconfidence more than forecasting ability.

> The thing that makes tail events easy to underappreciate is how easy it is to underestimate how things compound. How, for example, 9/11 prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which helped drive the housing bubble, which led to the financial crisis, which led to a poor jobs market, which led tens of millions to seek a college education, which led to $1.6 trillion in student loans with a 10.8% default rate. It's not intuitive to link 19 hijackers to the current weight of student loans, but that's what happens in a world driven by a few outlier tail events. **The majority of what's happening at any given moment in the global economy can be tied back to a handful of past events that were nearly impossible to predict**.

> "Whenever we are surprised by something, even if we admit that we made a mistake, we say, 'Oh I'll never make that mistake again.' But, in fact, what you should learn when you make a mistake because you did not anticipate something is that the world is difficult to anticipate. **That's the correct lesson to learn from surprises: that the world is surprising**." — Daniel Kahneman.

> The most important economic events of the future — things that will move the needle the most — are things that history gives us little to no guide about. They will be unprecedented events.

> Just before he died Benjamin Graham was asked whether detailed analysis of individual stocks — a tactic he became famous for — remained a strategy he favoured. He answered: "In general, no. I am no longer an advocate of elaborate techniques of security analysis in order to find superior value opportunities. This was a rewarding activity, say, 40 years ago, when our textbook was first published. But the situation has changed a great deal since then."

> "The 4 most dangerous words in investing are, 'it's different this time.'" — Michael Batnick.

The main message of this chapter is not to neglect history, but rather not to use it as an indication of future success. It stresses that the world is several orders of magnitude too complex for anyone to make correct forecasts. Looking back in history should result in generalised takeaway, for example that people are fundamentally driven by fear and greed.


### Room For Error
A *margin of safety* is critical to successful investing. In casinos, supposing that counting cards lends you 51-49 odds of winning in your favour, you still need to be conservative enough each session to prevent a streak of bad luck from wiping you out, even though you would have certainty of consistently winning in the long term. The idea of having a margin of safety was highly endorsed by Benjamin Graham:
> **"The purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary."**

> It is easy to underestimate what a 30% decline does to your psyche... Spreadsheets are good at telling you when the numbers do or don't add up. They're not good at modelling how you'll feel when you tuck your kids in at night wondering if the investment decisions you've made were a mistake that will hurt their future. Having a gap between what you can technically endure vs. what's emotionally possible is an overlooked version of room for error.

> Leverage is the devil here. Leverage — taking on debt to make your money go further — pushes routine risks into something capable of producing ruin. The danger is that rational optimism most of the time masks the odds of ruin some of the time.

You really don't need a specific reason to save. You should save to prepare for the things you couldn't prepare for.

### You'll Change
> Long-term financial planning is essential. But things — both the world around you, and your own goals and desires.

In the present, we're always living as the latest iteration of ourselves. We subconsciously believe ourselves to be mostly finalised, that our values and desires won't change. Research shows we radically underestimate how much will change over the next years and decades.
> "All of us are walking around with an illusion — an illusion that history, our personal history, has just come to an end, that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives." 

Don't polarise towards grinding endlessly and depriving yourself or consuming exuberantly and living life without care. You must strike a balance for sustainability, and to think otherwise will lead you to regret.
> We should avoid the extreme ends of financial planning. Assuming you'll be happy with a very low income, or choosing to work endless hours in pursuit of a high one, increases the odds that you'll one day find yourself at a point of regret.

### Everything Has a Price
... except it's often not listed on a label. No exceptions. Never trust that something is as good as it seems.
> Successful investing demands a price. But its currency is not dollars and cents. It's volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and regret — all of which are easy to overlook until you're dealing with them in real time.

> Few investors have the disposition to say, "I'm actually fine if I lose 20% of my money." This is doubly true for new investors who have never experienced a 20% decline.

Instead, view volatility as a fee. You're able to get good market returns on the condition that you can pay the emotional price of market volatility.

Take this lesson beyond money matters. Perhaps a cliché example is that of success — the fee for that is time and the pain of constant failure.

### You and Me
Be wary about taking investing cues from people whose time horizons are different. As a long-term investor, you're likely not trying to exploit bubbles — that's meant to be the short-term investor/trader's game.
> Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long term to mostly short term.

> Bubbles do their damage when long-term investors playing one game start taking their cues from those short-term traders playing another.

Don't be tempted by rapidly rising prices as a long-term investor.
> Rising prices persuade all investors in ways the best marketers envy. They are a drug that can turn value-conscious investors into dewy-eyed optimists, detached from their own reality by the actions of someone playing a different game than they are.

> Few things matter more with money than understanding your own time horizon and not being persuaded by the actions and behaviours of people playing different games than you are.

### The Seduction of Pessimism
We all subconsciously assign much greater weighting to negative events and forecasts than positive ones. A common manifestation of this is *loss aversion*.
> Tell someone that everything will be great and they're likely to either shrug you off or offer a skeptical eye. Tell someone they're in danger and you have their undivided attention.
