### No One is Crazy
> Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.

Everyone has their own idiosyncratic relationship with money, but they're all shaped by incredibly unique sets of circumstances and observations. Firmly held beliefs in one reasonable person can be totally at odds with beliefs in another reasonable person.

### Luck and Risk
Luck and risk (misfortune) are fundamental forces polarising people towards wild success and catastrophic failure. Detach from your ego and realise that luck played a massive role in your personal successes, and risk played a massive role in your failings. 

The book discusses Bill Gates as an example and Paul Allen, the founders of Microsoft. They attended a high school which was one of the only in the world that access to a computer in the 1960s. Of the ~300 million people of comparable age in existence at the time, you'd need to win a 1-in-a-million dice roll to have gone to this high school. There was also a third person, Kent Evans, who was a close friend with Gates and Allen, and equally ambitious and obsessed with the possibilities of modern computer, but who died to a mountaineering accident before graduating high school, another 1-in-a-million dice roll.

Emulating the decision-making of wildly successful people and expecting the same level of outcome is unreasonable.

> "One lucky break, or one supremely shrewd decision â€” can we tell them apart?" â€” Benjamin Graham, reflecting on his GEICO stock which violated the principles he wrote about in the Intelligent Investor, but which won him a huge fortune.

> The line between 'inspiringly bold' and 'foolishly reckless' can be a millimeter thick and only visible with hindsight.

In many cases, it is impossible to distinguish between luck and misfortune. **Never judge people for the way they are and things they've achieved**.

> **Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.**

> Therefore, **focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns**.

You can't fully attribute personal successes to inputs that you controlled â€” such as hard work, ambition and education. These are necessary inputs, but know that your outcomes are a complex function of luck.
> When things are going extremely well, realise it's not as good as you think. You are not invincible, and if you acknowledge that luck brought you success then **you have to believe in luck's cousin, risk, which can turn your story around just as quickly**.
