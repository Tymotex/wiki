title: Man's Search For Meaning
---

💎 Suffering is omnipresent and always expands to fill the conscious mind, no matter the magnitude.

> Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.

> The attempt to develop a sense of humour and to see things in a humourous light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living

Suffering is always a constant. Like a gas expanding to fill a chamber, suffering expands to fill your conscious mind. Happiness is always relative and can be surfaced in spite of extreme suffering.

> No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.

> We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: **the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances**, to choose one's own way.

> And there were always choices to make. Every day, every hour, offered the opportunity to make a decision, a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determined whether or not you would become the plaything of circumstance, renouncing freedom and dignity to become moulded into the form of the typical inmate.

> ... in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone.

> It is this spiritual freedom, which cannot be taken away, that makes life meaningful and purposeful.

> Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.
