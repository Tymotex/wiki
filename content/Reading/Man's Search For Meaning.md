title: Man's Search For Meaning
---

This book has really made me feel more capable in remaining stoic and sanguine in life, in spite of any tragedies I might face. I see a lot of meaning in my life â€” my family, my work, and the beauty of the natural world. 

ðŸ’Ž Suffering is omnipresent and always expands to fill the conscious mind, no matter the magnitude.

ðŸ’Ž Happiness is relative to the status quo. It's possible to experience happiness, even in a death camp.

> Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.

> The attempt to develop a sense of humour and to see things in a humourous light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living

Suffering is always a constant. Like a gas expanding to fill a chamber, suffering expands to fill your conscious mind. Happiness is always relative and can be surfaced in spite of extreme suffering.

> No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.

> We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: **the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances**, to choose one's own way.

> And there were always choices to make. Every day, every hour, offered the opportunity to make a decision, a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determined whether or not you would become the plaything of circumstance, renouncing freedom and dignity to become moulded into the form of the typical inmate.

> ... in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone.

> It is this spiritual freedom, which cannot be taken away, that makes life meaningful and purposeful.

> Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.

> One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or one could ignore the challenge and simply vegetate, as did a majority of the prisoners.

> ... it was the limitlessness of the term of imprisonment which was most acutely felt.

You must see your suffering as a means to some end. You must always have some future goal in mind to anchor your perception of your suffering.

> "Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it." â€” Spinoza

> The prisoner who had lost faith in the future â€” his future â€” was doomed. With his loss of belief in the future, he also lost his spiritual hold; he let himself decline and became subject to mental and physical decay.

> Those who know how close the connection is between the state of mind of a man â€” his courage and hope, or lack of them â€” and the state of immunity of his body will understand that the sudden loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect.

> "He who has a *why* to live for can bear with almost any *how*" â€” Nietzsche.

> Once the meaning of suffering had been revealed to us, we refused to minimise or alleviate the camp's tortures by ignore them or harbouring false illusions and entertaining artificial optimism.

In other words, you should be willing to fully experience suffering when the purpose of it is clear to you. I'd hate to diminish the significance of the message with a video game analogy, but most of the enjoyment comes in the constant failures and suffering one endures in the hardest parts of a game.

> ... someone looks down on each of us in difficult hours â€” a friend, a wife, somebody alive or dead, or a God â€” and he would not expect us to disappoint him. He would hope to find us **suffering proudly** â€” not miserably â€” knowing how to die.

> It is apparent that the mere knowledge that a man was either a camp guard or a prisoner tells us almost nothing. Human kindness can be found in all groups, even those which as a whole it would be easy to condemn.

Even when liberated, the prisoners were not suddenly overcome with joy. In fact, those who for which 'life didn't expect much from' resumed their apathy and resentment. You must always have something to look forward to â€” whether it be a loved one whose embrace you yearn for, or an unfinished piece of work, or a passion project.

## Logotherapy

*Logos* is the Greek word describing '*meaning*'. Logotherapy is a school of therapy centered on the pursuit of meaning and its importance in mental wellbeing.

> To be sure, man's search for meaning may arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium. However, precisely such tension is an indispensable prerequisite of mental health. There is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one's life.

> Thus it can be seen that mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become.

In my experience, feeling stress and seeing my own momentum towards goals and personal growth is a huge component of my mental health. I must always be conscientious and dissatisfied with my life in some way in order to feel mentally robust.

> What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.

> Existential frustration often eventuates in sexual compensation... sexual libido becomes rampant in the existential vacuum.
