> Meditation is the art of fully conscious living. What we make of our life — the sum total of thoughts, emotions, words, and actions that fill the brief interval between birth and death — is our one great creative masterpiece. The beauty and significance of a life well lived consists not in the works we leave behind or in what history has to say about us. It comes from the quality of conscious experience that infuses our every waking moment, and from the impact we have on others.

> Although pain and pleasure are an inevitable part of human life, suffering and happiness are entirely optional. The choice is ours.

You cannot wrestle your mind into submission and this isn't your fault. All that you 'do' to meditate is to express and hold a *conscious intention*. That's all you *can* do. Trust that the appropriate responses to your conscious intention follow.
> ... there is no "self" in charge of the mind, and therefore nobody to blame.

## Stage 1
Meditate everyday and *diligently*, meaning that you should genuinely uphold a commitment to the practice once you sit down. Mastery is attained when you can do this every day.

## Stage 2
> Willpower can't prevent the mind from forgetting the breath. Nor can you force yourself to become aware that the mind is wandering. Instead, just hold the intention to appreciate the "aha" moment that recognises mind-wandering, while gently but firmly redirecting attention back to the breath.
