> Meditation is the art of fully conscious living. What we make of our life — the sum total of thoughts, emotions, words, and actions that fill the brief interval between birth and death — is our one great creative masterpiece. The beauty and significance of a life well lived consists not in the works we leave behind or in what history has to say about us. It comes from the quality of conscious experience that infuses our every waking moment, and from the impact we have on others.

> Although pain and pleasure are an inevitable part of human life, suffering and happiness are entirely optional. The choice is ours.

You cannot wrestle your mind into submission and this isn't your fault. All that you 'do' to meditate is to express and hold a *conscious intention*. That's all you *can* do. Trust that the appropriate responses to your conscious intention follow.
> ... there is no "self" in charge of the mind, and therefore nobody to blame.

### Awareness and Attention
*Awareness* and *attention* are two distinct things. **Peripheral awareness** is the context — it's everything that makes up the current experience. It consists of the majority of the visual field, the ambience, the feeling of the chair you're sitting on, the forgettable thoughts that flutter by, etc. *Attention* is the spotlight shone on one thing.

Attention tends to produce a self-centered experience. When your attention is captured by thoughts of annoyance, you more naturally conclude that "I am annoyed". When the thoughts of annoyance are in your peripheral awareness, they become objects of consciousness along with the background noise, physical sensations, etc.

**Awareness and attention are at odds with each other**. Increasing attention requires diminishing awareness (think of the 'flow' experience where you lose context of time and feel as if you have no thoughts whatsoever) and vice versa. When captured by something without realising, such as intense anger, awareness diminishes, withdrawing the context and objectiveness required to respond appropriately. 
> For example, if your partner had a bad day at work and complains about the food you made, it takes mindfulness to maintain an objective awareness that recognises the real cause of the complaint. But when strong emotions take hold, all your energy pours into hyperfocused attention as you go into fight-or-flight mode. Your awareness fails, and attention hones in on the criticism as a personal attack.

## Stage 1
Meditate everyday and *diligently*, meaning that you should genuinely uphold a commitment to the practice once you sit down. Mastery is attained when you can do this every day.

### How to Meditate
Before you meditate, go through this procedure:
1. **Motivation** — why are you doing this? Don't judge yourself for your reasons.
2. **Goals** — what are you going to do in this session? E.g. maintain posture.
3. **Expectations** — remember that your attention and fluctuates massively day to day and month to month. Don't expect perfect attention.
4. **Diligence** — wholeheartedly commit to the practice. Don't just fall asleep.
5. **Distractions** — what's been on your mind today? Those are the things likely to distract you during this session.
6. **Posture** — doing whatever is necessary to be upright and relaxed.

When you begin:
1. *Arrive immediately*. Open your peripheral awareness as wide as possible by noticing every sensation you can.
2. Direct attention towards the rise and fall of the abdomen and chest and the nose and upper lip.
3. Focus on the nose and upper lip.
	- Counting in-breaths and out-breaths is useful as a beginner. Don't count more than 10 or less than 5.
4. When your attention is inevitably captured, direct it back to the breath without chastising yourself. 
	- Appreciate the 'a-ha moment' when you've realised that you've been captured by thought or distraction. That a-ha moment is completely unconscious. So is being distracted. It's pointless to chastise yourself because your unconscious is responsible for the distraction and realisation cycle.
	- Don't try to narrow your peripheral awareness. Keep all contextual sensations and thoughts in the background.

### The 5 Hindrances
1. **Worldly desire** — hedonism and status.
2. **Aversion** — hatred, dissatisfaction and resistance.
3. **Laziness and lethargy**.
4. **Remorse and worry**.
5. **Doubt**

## Stage 2
> Willpower can't prevent the mind from forgetting the breath. Nor can you force yourself to become aware that the mind is wandering. Instead, just hold the intention to appreciate the "aha" moment that recognises mind-wandering, while gently but firmly redirecting attention back to the breath.

## Stage 3
*Label* distractions as you realise you've been captured by them. For instance, if you're thinking about what to do after the meditation, label it as "planning", then return to the meditation object.

*Check-in* regularly and briefly to train your introspective awareness to catch distractions before you completely capture your attention. Do this habitually after some interval (e.g. every 12 breaths), but don't be strict on the exact regularity.
