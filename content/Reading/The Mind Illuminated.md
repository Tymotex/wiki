> Meditation is the art of fully conscious living. What we make of our life — the sum total of thoughts, emotions, words, and actions that fill the brief interval between birth and death — is our one great creative masterpiece. The beauty and significance of a life well lived consists not in the works we leave behind or in what history has to say about us. It comes from the quality of conscious experience that infuses our every waking moment, and from the impact we have on others.

> Although pain and pleasure are an inevitable part of human life, suffering and happiness are entirely optional. The choice is ours.

You cannot wrestle your mind into submission and this isn't your fault. All that you 'do' to meditate is to express and hold a *conscious intention*. That's all you *can* do. Trust that the appropriate responses to your conscious intention follow.
> ... there is no "self" in charge of the mind, and therefore nobody to blame.

### Awareness and Attention
*Awareness* and *attention* are two distinct things. **Peripheral awareness** is the context — it's everything that makes up the current experience. It consists of the majority of the visual field, the ambience, the feeling of the chair you're sitting on, the forgettable thoughts that flutter by, etc. *Attention* is the spotlight shone on one thing.

Attention tends to produce a self-centered experience. When your attention is captured by thoughts of annoyance, you more naturally conclude that "I am annoyed". When the thoughts of annoyance are in your peripheral awareness, they become objects of consciousness along with the background noise, physical sensations, etc.

**Awareness and attention are at odds with each other**. Increasing attention requires diminishing awareness (think of the 'flow' experience where you lose context of time and feel as if you have no thoughts whatsoever) and vice versa. When captured by something without realising, such as intense anger, awareness diminishes, withdrawing the context and objectiveness required to respond appropriately. 
> For example, if your partner had a bad day at work and complains about the food you made, it takes mindfulness to maintain an objective awareness that recognises the real cause of the complaint. But when strong emotions take hold, all your energy pours into hyperfocused attention as you go into fight-or-flight mode. Your awareness fails, and attention hones in on the criticism as a personal attack.

## Stage 1
Meditate everyday and *diligently*, meaning that you should genuinely uphold a commitment to the practice once you sit down. Mastery is attained when you can do this every day.

## Stage 2
> Willpower can't prevent the mind from forgetting the breath. Nor can you force yourself to become aware that the mind is wandering. Instead, just hold the intention to appreciate the "aha" moment that recognises mind-wandering, while gently but firmly redirecting attention back to the breath.
