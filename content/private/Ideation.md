## App Ideas
Habit tracker that properly gamifies things.
- Procedurally generate a world/island/ecosystem that grows based on the person's performance. Trees start growing, towns start emerging when the person does well. Terrain starts becoming barren and graveyards spawn when the person becomes negligent.
- Widget for easy progress logging.
- Graph visualisation.
- Weekly email digests.
- Timer and stopwatch that logs activities (like Forest).
- Web and mobile interfaces.

An extensible When2Meet clone. This might be a great beginning app to try making before launching more ambitious projects. This would be useful as a replacement to When2Meet, which is already widespread and lacks competitors.
- Launch a prototype, then rope in friends.
- Timeweave features.
