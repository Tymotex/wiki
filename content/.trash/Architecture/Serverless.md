*Serverless computing* is basically about getting servers in the [[Knowledge/Engineering/cloud/Cloud Computing|cloud]] to execute some code snippets ([[Knowledge/Engineering/cloud/FaaS|FaaS]]) or utilise something like a database service with a pay-as-you-go pricing model (typically) and with no need to be concerned with capacity planning, horizontal scaling, hardware failure, etc.

> 'Serverless' is a bit of a misleading name because the code obviously still executes on actual servers, they're just not maintained by you so can essentially be oblivious to their existence from a black-box perspective.

**Note**: for some reason I had always assumed serverless computing and [[Knowledge/Engineering/architecture/Microservice|microservice]] had something to do with each other. They don't, but they're occasionally used in the same project. *Serverless* is about how you run an app, while *microservices* are about how you architect an app. They're both very frequently encountered in cloud computing.
