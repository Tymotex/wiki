Need a Figma design. Literally just one page is enough. Spend 2 hours on this next morning after meeting with dad.

**Agenda:**
- How are things going now?
- What is the target audience? HSC? If so, then focus on writing and solving and producing HSC questions.
    - Find existing HSC resources for maths.
    - What could they be doing better?
    - What niche could we fill?
        - Eg. solving practice problems for 2U, 3U and 4U and providing in-depth explanations.
    - Let's just focus on maths and only maths, otherwise efforts will be too shallowly allocated.
- How do we make sure we make progress on this project?
- MVP for release. What more needs to be done?
