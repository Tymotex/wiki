Need a Figma design. Literally just one page is enough. Spend 2 hours on this next morning after meeting with dad.

**Agenda:**

-   How are things going now?
-   What is the target audience? HSC? If so, then focus on writing and solving and producing HSC questions.
-   How do we make sure we make progress on this project?
