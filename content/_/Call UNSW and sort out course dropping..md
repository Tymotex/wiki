Good afternoon, I was transferred from the Nucleus.

I was looking to get some help with dropping my courses for this term?

My situation is I've fulfilled all my graduation requirements last term, but I decided to take 2 courses this term. I wanted to drop them all but I couldn't drop the last one because myUNSW prevents me from doing it, saying I need to apply for program leave.
