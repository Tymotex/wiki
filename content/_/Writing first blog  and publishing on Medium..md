Make a Medium account (don’t be afraid to just pay…). 
Write a blog on personal knowledge management.


You should seriously blog and do it consistently. Trust in the worth of doing it. Pick your overarching niche that’s specific enough for you to dominate at it.
Pretend you work for a newspaper which has a deadline that has to be met and you have to publish your post, ready or not.
In time, results will come. Most people are not patient or consistent enough to wait for results, and that is why most people fail to get what they want out of life. Remember that.
Try writing like you talk.
Despite how bad you might suck, how painful it feels and how much you think you just aren’t a writer and no one will possibly read what you wrote, do it anyway and keep doing it.
