**Prep**:
- Wear: dark chinos, red jumper, purple shirt, brown monk-strap shoes. Don't give a fuck.
- Do your hair. Straighten it, use sea salt spray and pomade to give it volume.
- Start preparing at **10:00AM**. Leave at 10:40AM.

**Social**:
- Greet: "Hi! It's really nice to see you again!"
- Remember: just take deep breaths and slow down your speaking, and **SPEAK LOUDER YOU FUCKING NERD**.
- Just be yourself, these are your friends basically.
- What I've been up to:
    - Wrapping up university.
    - Reading books.
      Self-help books (a bit embarrassing), software engineering textbooks (PP and DMMT), personal finance and investing because I only realised this year that I know nothing about that.
    - Nand2Tetris.
    - Working on a few projects just for fun. (portfolio site, )
- Topics to talk about:
    - Has the office changed much?
    - Does the team go into office much?
    - Do you have any book recommendations?
    - Do you have any hobbies to recommend?
    - Do you have any recommendations for where to travel?
    - Does anyone have any recommendations for what I could spend some time learning between now and when I start working?
    - Did all of you enjoy university?
    - What would each of you have done if you didn't go for software engineering?
