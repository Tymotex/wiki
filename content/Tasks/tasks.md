What are *all* the strategies?<br><br>Okay they're basically:<br>- Sleep well (obviously)<br>- Stay hydrated (this is probably the one I was least careful about)<br>- Eat lighter meals but more frequently<br>- Don't eat a fuckload of carbs and proteins. <br>- Also don't double down on fatty foods. It contributes to food coma as well.<br>- A general rule: eat light, stay hydrated. Eat more frequently to compensate for a less filling meal.<br>- Get some light exercise in, somehow.
- [x] ==1== **(45 mins)** Pick a protein powder.
