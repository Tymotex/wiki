**Review of 2022**: this was a year of unrealised potential. I had so much time that I'll never have again. I write this from a stance of regret. Now I have learned the pain of letting myself think about how else I could have spent this time. I also realised the role that having deadlines plays in one's life. I think I would have accomplished so much more if there were clear deadlines enforced externally. I would have also performed better if I were around people who I saw as healthy competition, like in university. Next year, I'll begin working, and I'll start being around incredibly smart and hard-working people.

Some things I did well: I read quite a number of books this year, I worked on a number of projects this year, I planned a trip, became much better at lifting weights, became more knowledgeable about nutrition and diet, and I learned more about investing. I feel rejuvenated and ready to focus on the year ahead.

Some things I wish I did more of: I wish I had taken more bold, uncomfortable steps. I wish I had met more people. I wish I had done more for mum and dad. I wish I had read more books in the first half of the year.

I didn't hit *most* of the goals I had written below. I think I had written far too many and diluted my focus. For next year, I'll write a large set of things, but I'll only set a few as focuses on a per-month basis. I had a **major slump** from Oct 25 all the way to mid December. There, I went back to binge gaming for several days, I regressed back to PMO binging. I just became an awful person and I'm deeply ashamed at how I behaved. This slump taught me the importance of momentum. I let myself relax for a little too long and got mired in that lifestyle. I shouldn't go full throttle, but every day I should just give myself a nudge towards being a more productive, good man. I've started picking up momentum again, and all I have to do is just give myself a nudge each day to keep the momentum going. Remember, average speed trumps top speed.
