# Life Roadmap
>ðŸ’¡ Your 20s timeline deserves to be stretched to postpone â€˜settling downâ€™.

## 20s
**Age 21-25**: Build identity capital and taking risks.
- In early 20s, focus primarily on acquiring in-demand technical software engineering skills. Learn a small set of things deeply, but learn something about everything.
- Develop in your other hobbies (guitar, powerlifting, and maybe something else).
- Own a house for investment purposes.
- Take risks and be bold. Always prefer discomfort over comfort and familiarity.
- Be an attractive person. Date at least a few times a year.

**Age 25-30**: Attain stability and security (financially, emotionally, etc.) and find love.
- Find a person you can build a life and make difficult decisions with and who will stay by your side throughout it all.
- Peak in your career. Be incredibly valuable to those around you and dominant in the software engineering industry. Take on leadership roles.
- Take on physically challenging travel goals while you have all this energy and risk-taking tolerance.

## 30+
**Age 30-50**: Be a loving husband and a hero for your children. Start pivoting towards [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/).
- Have a child with your partner when youâ€™re around age 30.
- Have a second child with your partner some years after the first child.
- Leveraging your career capital, pursue work in a non-profit organisation/startup that seeks to solve a tractable global problem.

**Age 50-60**:
- Be financially independent and have enough wealth to not stress about emergency funds and university tuition fees for your children.
- Give back to the world. Somehow. Perhaps through teaching, writing, charity, volunteer work or something else.

**Age 60+**:
- Continue giving back to the world all of that youâ€™ve accumulated over your life, whether itâ€™s knowledge, fortune, love, etc.
- Have a beautiful garden to tend to.
- Exercise with your wife.
- Continue reading and piecing together a better understanding of the world.
