# 2023
These are all my goals:
1. **(Career)** Get promoted to L4 at Google.
2. **(Career)** Get C++ readability.
3. **(Career)** Read 1 technical book a month, on average.
4. **(Career)** Ship 1 interesting personal project.
5. **(Personal)** Read 1 book a fortnight, on average.
6. 

- **Love** â€” this isn't going to be a focus. I'm a worthless young man and need to build myself up first.
    - You must increase your value: looks, career, integrity.
    - Ask out someone and go on at least 1 date.
- **Health**
    - End the year between 76kg (24.5 BMI) to 80kg (25.8 BMI). The 24.5 BMI is apparently most attractive according to women while 25.8 BMI is most aesthetic according to men.
    - Try Jiu Jitsu midyear.
    - Squat 150kg (or 2x bodyweight). 
    - Deadlift 160kg (or 2.2x bodyweight).
    - Bench 120kg (or 1.65x bodyweight).
    - Strict barbell curl 45kg.
- **Family**
    - Help mum and dad get low-stress regular income.
- **Self-Improvement**
    - Continue to meditate 15-20 mins every day.
    - Actually stick to a schedule... Seriously, you've actually never done this before.
    - Something related to conquering social fears. Start being able to **talk to people**.
