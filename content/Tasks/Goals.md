# 2023
These are all my goals:
1. **(Career)** Get promoted to L4 at Google (for the 2024 March promo cycle).
3. **(Career)** Read 1 technical book a month, on average.
5. **(Personal)** Read 1 book a fortnight, on average.
6. **(Personal)** Don't watch porn this year. Not even once.
9. **(Personal)** Ensure mum starts her Chinese school.
4. **(Personal)** Ship 1 interesting personal project.
7. **(Personal)** Talk to people and make new friends (this goal is unformulated at the moment).
	- As of mid Feb, I've made quite a lot of connections. I think after a little longer, I'd be able to call them friends :). I feel like I've stepped out of my shell a lot in the last few weeks after starting my job at Google.
8. **(Personal)** Ask at least 1 person out successfully and go on at least 1 date.
	- I should ask out Cleo this year. I'm attracted to her. I'm not ashamed or afraid of any consequences. Put a date to this.
9. **(Personal)** Meditate at least 10 mins every day.
10. **(Gym)** Run 5km every day for a month at any pace.
11. **(Gym)** Run at least 3km for 90% of your days, except sick days.
12. **(Gym)** Push yourself extremely hard on a run once, like your life is on the line.
13. **(Gym)** End the year between 76kg (24.5 BMI) to 80kg (25.8 BMI).
14. **(Gym)** By December 31st, have 1RM: 
	1. Squat 2x body weight (150kg),
	2. Deadlift 2.2x body weight (160kg),
	3. Bench 1.6x body weight (115kg),
	4. OHP 1x body weight (75kg).
15. ~~**(Gym)** Try Jiu Jitsu midyear, at least for the free trial.~~
	- Tried this in Google as of Jan/Feb. It's great, but requires quite a lot of commitment.
	- Did a trial at SJJA Gladesville in March. It was okay, but I'd be better off powerlifting in the meantime I think.

## January
This month, I'll focus on settling into my job and getting used to a regular schedule. That's really just one goal this month: **make a schedule and stick to it for the whole month**.

In my job, I will work hard for the purpose of *learning* and becoming more proficient. I will have the goal of reaching L4 in the back of my mind, but in the day-to-day, the goal is to learn and work hard. I am intrinsically motivated by learning and by hard work, and this is what will carry me through to the end goal â€” whatever I choose it to be.

Here are some books I want to finish this month:
- [ ] **(Programming)** Site Reliability Engineering
- [ ] **(Programming)** A Tour of C++
- [x] Meditations
- [ ] The Obstacle is the Way
- [ ] On Writing Well.
- [x] The Way of the Superior Man
- [ ] ~~Never Eat Alone~~

## February
January didn't go so great. Starting work just injected so much chaos into my life. I'm only barely getting it under control. My sleep was terrible for the last few weeks but I finally feel like I have enough under my control now to be able to sleep better. This month, I'm going to get ahead at work and feel in control there. That's all for this month.

I finished 'Waking Up' this month.

## March
I actually skipped writing this... feelsbad. It's April now so I'm looking back. I spent this entire month preoccupied with my career. I'm a bit disappointed with how things went this month. I made okay progress at work, but that's about it.

This month I finished reading 'Ego is the Enemy' and 'Selfish Gene'.

## April
I'm culling down my list of goals a bit. As always, it was a bit too ambitious. I didn't realise how big of a commitment full-time work was.

I added a few goals for running since I really want to decrease my resting heart rate and increase my mental fortitude and build discipline (3km every non-sick day, no excuses).

I haven't watched porn so far, but I was close a few times.

Scott Galloway's advice for 20s/30s:
- Lift heavy weights and run long distances. Learn what it is like to feel like you're at your limit (but in fact are only 40% of the true limit). Learn this and you'll know the next time you're feeling at your limit that you have so much more to give.
	> "It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable." - Socrates.
- 'Be in a city'. Be around the best people of a large population, of your industry, of your communities. 
- Get out as often as possible, force yourself to meet people. Develop the skills to begin opening. You need opportunities to meet a mate. Who you pair up with is ***the*** most important decision in your life. *Give yourself as many shots as possible*. **This is the most important advice**, you need this so bad. Have the courage to just talk to people, take social risks, etc.
