# 2023
These are all my goals:
1. **(Career)** Get promoted to L4 at Google.
2. **(Career)** Get C++ readability.
3. **(Career)** Read 1 technical book a month, on average.
5. **(Personal)** Read 1 book a fortnight, on average.
6. **(Personal)** Make a schedule that you stick to for at least 3 months.
6. **(Personal)** Don't watch porn this year. Not even once. Masturbate no more than 4 times a month.
9. **(Personal)** Ensure mum and dad have low-stress regular income by the end of the first quarter.
4. **(Personal)** Ship 1 interesting personal project.
7. **(Personal)** Talk to people and make new friends (this goal is unformulated at the moment).
	- As of mid Feb, I've made quite a lot of connections. I think after a little longer, I'd be able to call them friends :). I feel like I've stepped out of my shell a lot in the last few weeks after starting my job at Google.
8. **(Personal)** Ask at least 1 person out successfully and go on at least 1 date.
9. **(Gym)** End the year between 76kg (24.5 BMI) to 80kg (25.8 BMI).
10. **(Gym)** Squat 2x body weight (150kg), deadlift 2.2x body weight (160kg), bench 1.6x body weight (115kg), strict curl 45kg.
11. **(Gym)** Try Jiu Jitsu midyear, at least for the free trial.
	- Tried this in Google as of Jan/Feb. It's great, but requires quite a lot of commitment.

## January
This month, I'll focus on settling into my job and getting used to a regular schedule. That's really just one goal this month: **make a schedule and stick to it for the whole month**.

In my job, I will work hard for the purpose of *learning* and becoming more proficient. I will have the goal of reaching L4 in the back of my mind, but in the day-to-day, the goal is to learn and work hard. I am intrinsically motivated by learning and by hard work, and this is what will carry me through to the end goal — whatever I choose it to be.

Here are some books I want to finish this month:
- [ ] **(Programming)** Site Reliability Engineering
- [ ] **(Programming)** A Tour of C++
- [x] Meditations
- [ ] The Obstacle is the Way
- [ ] On Writing Well.
- [x] The Way of the Superior Man
- [ ] ~~Never Eat Alone~~

## February
January didn't go so great. Starting work just injected so much chaos into my life. I'm only barely getting it under control. My sleep was terrible for the last few weeks but I finally feel like I have enough under my control now to be able to sleep better. This month, I'm going to get ahead at work and feel in control there. That's all for this month.

I hope to finish the Waking Up book this month and the textbooks I listed for January.
