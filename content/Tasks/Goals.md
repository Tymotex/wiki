TODO: check out Google tasks.
- What's your goal for Google next year? Get promoted to L4.


Unformulated goals:
- **Career**
    - Get promoted to L4. Work your ass off. Don't think about starting your own venture, you need this time working under someone else so you can learn from them. Leave your dreams of entrepreneurship to later.
- **Programming**
    - Read technical books:
        - Fundamentals of Software Architecture
        - Clean Code
        - Site Reliability Engineering
        - Software Engineering at Google
    - 
- **Love** â€” this isn't going to be a focus. I'm a worthless young man and need to build myself up first.
    - Ask out someone and go on at least 1 date.
- **Health**
    - End the year between 76kg (24.5 BMI) to 80kg (25.8 BMI). The 24.5 BMI is apparently most attractive according to women while 25.8 BMI is most aesthetic according to men.
    - Squat 150kg.
    - Deadlift 160kg.
    - Bench 120kg.
    - Strict barbell curl 45kg.
