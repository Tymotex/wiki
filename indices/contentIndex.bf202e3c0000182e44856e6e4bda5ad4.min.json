You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.689821913Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.69382193Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?

They're *stateful* functions which return the next value in a list of values for each successive invocation.\n\nUsually, programming languages will give you a `yield` keyword which works basically the same way as `return`, but when the function is invoked again, execution resumes after the last `yield`. For example, below is a generator in Python.\n```python\ndef foo_generator():\n\tyield 2\n\tyield 3\n\tyield 5\n\ng = foo_generator()\nprint(next(g))      # → 2\nprint(next(g))      # → 3\nprint(next(g))      # → 5\n```\nAt each `yield` statement, execution is suspended at that line and exeuction resumes at the line right after until the next `yield` or until the function terminates.\n\n**Note**: normally, when you invoke a function, a [[Stack Frame|stack frame]] gets allocated on the [[Program Memory#Stack|stack]] section of memory. When you invoke a generator function, the 'stack' frame actually gets allocated in the [[Program Memory#Heap|heap]] instead (at least in [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython)) and so they persist separately from the regular function call stack.\n\n### Generators \u0026 Iterator\nAll *generators* are [[Iterators|iterators]]. When you invoke a generator function, it returns an *iterator* which you can loop through by invoking some function/method like `next` on them (in the case of Python).\n\n### Why Use Generators?\nNormally, when you need a list of values of some kind, you'd call a function which returns that entire list of values back to you. Generators are *lazy*, so they only return one value of a stream of values at a time. In other words, you get values from a stream of values *on-demand* rather than getting all values upfront. This is great when you don't know how many values from a stream of values you might need. If you really needed the first 10 values, but you loaded all 1000 values upfront, for example, you're hogging an **unnecessarily large amount of memory**. With generators, you only really hold the memory for a single value of the list, so it's a really common way to optimise for memory usage.\n\nGenerators are also a great way to represent streams of infinite values. For example, it might make sense to write a prime numbers generator function only get the next prime number, on-demand.\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.69382193Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/concepts/IaaS":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.69382193Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/concepts/Iterators":{"title":"","content":"An **iterator** is an *object* that lets you loop through an **iterable**, usually by invoking, implicitly or explicitly, a `next` method.\n- In Python, iterators are objects that expose the `__next__`  [[Python#Dunder Methods|dunder method]] which can be invoked to retrieve the next value in the **iterable**.\n\nAn **iterable** is an object containing a collection of items that you can *get an **iterator** from*, usually, via a method. Iterables are stateless and have no concept of what element is the 'current' element in a traversal – that is what the iterator handles.\n- In Python, that method is `__iter__`.\n- In C++, that method is usually `begin`.\n\nMany programming languages give you a for-loop variant that basically serves as syntactic sugar in using looping through the items in an **iterable**.\n- In Python, when you say `for item in iterable`, what happens behind the scenes is the iterable's `__iter__` method gets called to get an iterator, then `item` is assigned to whatever the iterator's `__next__` method returns. The for loop stops when `__next__` raises a `StopIteration` exception.\n- In C++, they're called *range-based for* loops with the syntax `for (T item : iterable) statements`.\n- In C#, they're called *foreach* loops with the syntax `foreach (T item in iterable) statements`.\n- In JavaScript, they're called *for of* loops with the syntax `for (let item of iterable) statements`\n- ... and so on.\n\n### Iterator Design Pattern\nThe purpose of iterators is to let the user access the elements of a data structure through a consistent interface, regardless of whether they're iterating through items in a vector, a binary search tree, a graph, a hash map, etc. All these data structures will provide a way for the user to get an iterator from them that can be used in a for loop, for example.\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.69382193Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/concepts/PaaS":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.69382193Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/concepts/Program-Memory":{"title":"","content":"\n\n### Stack\nTODO.\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.69382193Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/concepts/SaaS":{"title":"","content":"# SaaS\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.69382193Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/concepts/Scaling":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.69382193Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/concepts/Stack-Frame":{"title":"","content":"TODO.\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.69382193Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/concepts/Type-System":{"title":"","content":"A *type system* is a set of rules defined by a programming language specification that assigns a *type* to every variable, expression, function, and possibly other things beyond those. \n\n### Why Type Systems Exist\nType systems exist for one reason: to help you write less buggy code in a more self-documenting way.\n- Giving variables, values, functions, etc. a *type* restricts the set of things you can do with them which helps us by minimising the chance of creating situations where the program tries to add the integer `3` to an instance of `Cat`. \n- It forces users of an interface to always supply an expected value.\n\n### Static Typing\nA *statically typed language* is one where the type system's rules are checked when you run the compiler (ie. at compile-time). It's called 'static' because any type system violations are caught before you execute a single line of your program.\n- Languages like [[C]] and [[Java]] are statically typed. Every valid C or Java program will always know what type an expression, variable, function has before execution.\n\n### Dynamic Typing\nA *dynamically typed language* is one where the type system's rules are checked during the execution of the program rather than at compile-time. In other words, nothing has a type until you run the program, and only then do the types get assigned to expressions, variables, functions, etc.\n- [[Python]] is a dynamically typed language. You could code up some very obvious type errors like `x = 1 + \"hi\"` but the program will run fine until it actually executes that line.\n- There is an important trade-off to recognise between static typing and dynamic typing: you would get fewer run-time errors with static typing, however dynamic typing affords you far more flexibility, which generally helps you implement things faster (at least in the short-term).\n\n### Strong Typing\nThere's a lack of a formal definition for this, but a *strongly typed* language is basically one where it is *not possible* for the developer to bypass the type system's rules. In other words, a value's type never changes in unexpected ways, such as through *implicit casts*.\n- [[Python]] is a strongly typed language. It's not possible to implicitly typecast values.\n- **Note**: a language can be both strongly and dynamically typed.\n\t```python\n\tx = 42\n\tx = \"Hello\"\n\t```\n\n### Weak Typing\nJust like *strong typing*, there is a lack of a formal definition, but in general: weakly typed programming languages are ones that have a more relaxed enforcement of its type system's rules, meaning that it's possible to violate/bypass them.\n- [[C]] is a classic weakly typed language. Pointers and integers are pretty much fully interchangeable, and you can freely convert a pointer of any type to a pointer of any other type.\n\t\u003e \"C is not a strongly-typed language, but as it has evolved, its type checking has been strengthened. \" - Dennis Ritchie.\n- [[JavaScript]] is also a weakly typed language. It's notorious for silently producing (sometimes hilariously) unintuitive results.\n\t```javascript\n\t\"11\" + 1 === \"111\"\n\t\"11\" — 1 === 10\n\n\t('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() === \"banana\"   // See an explanation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57456188/why-is-the-result-of-ba-a-a-tolowercase-banana\n\t```\n \nSometimes, we talk about the relative *weakness* of the type system between different programming languages. Eg. C++ is not strongly typed, however it is consider 'stronger' than C.\n\n**Note**: people often confuse *weak* typing to mean *dynamic* typing, and *strong* typing with *static* typing. They're completely separate. For example, C is both weakly typed and statically typed, while Python is both strongly typed and dynamically typed.\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.69382193Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/frameworks/Vue.js":{"title":"","content":"# Vue.js\nVue.js is ...\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.697821947Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/programming-languages/C":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.697821947Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/programming-languages/C++":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.697821947Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/programming-languages/CSS":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.697821947Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/programming-languages/Java":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.697821947Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/programming-languages/JavaScript":{"title":"","content":"TODO.\n\nThere's also [[TypeScript]].\n\n\n## Prototypes\nTODO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Rest Operator\nTODO.\n\n\n### Generators\nTODO.\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.697821947Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/programming-languages/Python":{"title":"","content":"\n\n\n\n\n### Dunder Methods\nTODO.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.697821947Z","tags":null},"/software-engineering/programming-languages/TypeScript":{"title":"","content":"TypeScript is a programming language made by Microsoft that is *superset* of [[JavaScript]]. The reason that TypeScript exists is to make complex JavaScript projects more maintainable and less error-prone by introducing a [[Type System#Static Typing|static]] and [[Type System#Strong Typing|strong]] type system. Essentially, it just gives developers a lot of quality-of-life improvements over JavaScript.\n\nTypeScript gets compiled (or more precisely, '*transpiled*') to JavaScript in the end. This is not new, languages like CoffeeScript, Dart, Scala, etc. can all have JavaScript as what we call a *compilation target*.\n\n**Why TypeScript is [loved](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-language-love-dread)**\n- Your IDE/editor gets more information about your code and give you very helpful intellisense and code-completion that is not possible with JavaScript. This reason alone, in my experience, pretty much negates any loss in developer velocity from using TypeScript over JavaScript.\n- Many errors will surface *as you're developing* rather than after your code is deployed to production and angry customers complain to you.\n- Types serve as a very useful form of documentation for how your functions are to be used and fields an object should contain. You can have a lot more confidence in refactoring a function when you have confidence about what the input types are.\n- Complex objects are much *less unpleasant* to work with. You'll know what its *shape* is (basically what properties it has and what its nested objects look like), what properties are compulsory or optional and you'll actually know when you've mispelt a property name.\n- You'll *almost* never have `cannot read property '...' of undefined` again.\n\nThe only main reasons *not* to use TypeScript are because:\n- You're stuck with a legacy JavaScript codebase.\n- You or your teammates are not willing to learn it, and you need to produce output fast in the short-term (like in a hackathon).\n- The project is a very simple or one-off thing that it's not worth setting up the build system.\n\n---\n```toc\nstyle: number\nmin_depth: 1\nmax_depth: 6\n```\n---\n## Setup\nInstall Node.js, `npm` or `yarn`. Then, install `tsc`, the open-source typescript compiler, as a dev dependency in a javascript project:\n```bash\nyarn init   # Inside the project root directory, if it's a new project.\nyarn add --dev typescript @types/node ts-node\n```\n### tsconfig.json\nEvery typescript project should have a `tsconfig.json` file at the root of the project directory. It tells `tsc` which files to compile, where to dump the resulting javascript, and so on. A basic config looks like this (but there are so many [more options](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig)):\n```json\n{\n\t\"compilerOptions\": {\n\t\t\"lib\": [   // Which APIs are available to the transpiled JS code? Eg. es2015 has Function.prototype.bind, etc.\n\t\t\t\"es2015\"\n\t\t],\n\t\t\"module\": \"commonjs\", // Which module system should be used by the transpiled JS code?\n\t\t\"outDir\": \"dist\",     // Where should the output JS files go?\n\t\t\"sourceMap\": true,    // Whether to generate a source map.\n\t\t\"strict\": true,       // All code must be properly typed.\n\t\t\"target\": \"es2015\"    // What JS version to compile to.\n\t},\n\t\"include\": [   // Directories containing .ts files we want to transpile.\n\t\t\"src\"\n\t]\n}\n```\nAlternatively, you can generate a `tsconfig.json` with `tsc --init`.\n\nSome recommended flags include:\n- `noImplicitThis`, which forces a type to be explicitly assinged to `this` inside functions. See [[TypeScript#this]].\n\n## Typing\nBroadly speaking, in programming languages, a *type* is a [[Set Theory#Sets|set]] of values, plus the properties/methods available to them.\n\n### Assigning Types\nAssigning types is straightforward in TypeScript, you just postfix a variable or parameter with a colon and a type. \n```typescript\n// Typing variables.\nlet a: number = 42;\nlet b: string;\n```\n\n### Defining Types\nRemember, types are just [[Set Theory#Sets|sets]] of values. When you define a *type*, you are just defining a set of values. The following are all examples of custom types you can define:\n```typescript\ntype TwoOrFour = 2 | 4;                           // The set consisting of 2 and 4.\ntype Value = string | number;                     // The set of all strings and all numbers.\ntype RandomThings = \"Hello\" | 42 | null | RegExp; // The set consisting of \"Hello\", 42, null and all instances of `RegExp`.\n```\n\n#### Type Alias\nYou can declare *type aliases* in a very similar way as to how you define variables. Type aliases are block-scoped, just like local variables.\n```typescript\ntype Person = { age: number, name: string };\n\n// Typescript will never infer that `me` is of type `Person` unless you explicitly say.\nconst me: Person = {\n\tage: 21,\n\tname: \"Tim\"\n};\n```\n\n#### Union and Intersection\nAgain, types are just *sets* of values. To expand the size of a set, you can union it with other sets, and to narrow the size of a set, you can intersect it other sets. In TypeScript, we use `|` to union two types and `\u0026` to intersect two types.\n```typescript\ntype Student = { id: string; degree: string };\ntype Tutor = { id: string; courses: string[] };\n\ntype StudentOrTutor = Student | Tutor;    // Set of all objects that are either `Student`, `Tutor`, or both.\ntype StudentAndTutor = Student \u0026 Tutor;   // Set of all objects containing all fields of `Student` AND `Tutor`.\n\nconst student: Student = { id: '111', degree: 'Bachelor of Science' };\nconst tutor: Tutor = { id: '222', courses: ['CS101'] };\nconst studentTutor: StudentAndTutor = {\n\tid: '333',\n\tdegree: 'Bachelor of Computer Science',\n\tcourses: ['CS201'],\n};\n\n// For `Student | Tutor`: you can assign any of: `Student`, `Tutor`, or `Student \u0026 Tutor`\nconst uniGoers: StudentOrTutor[] = [student, tutor, studentTutor];\n\n// For `Student \u0026 Tutor`: you can only have people who are simultaneously `Student` and `Tutor`.\nconst studentTutors: StudentAndTutor[] = [studentTutor];\n```\n- To make a type nullable, you can union it with `null` like this: `type MiddleName = string | null;`\n\n### TypeScript Built-In Types\nTypeScript introduces some new built-in data types that aren't present in JavaScript. These are: `any`, `unknown`, `void`, [`never`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#the-never-type).\n#### any\nThe `any` type represents the set of *all* values. You can assign a variable of type `any` to a number, a string, a WebServer object, etc. Only use `any` as a last resort – always prefer assigning the most specific type that you can. Often, people treat `any` as a way to 'opt' out of TypeScript for a small part of the code. When something is `any`, you are free to do erroneous things on it such as invoking methods on it that don't exist, using in arithmetic expressions, accessing undefined properties, etc.\n\n#### unknown\nThe `unknown` type represents the set of *all* values, just like `any`. The difference is that TypeScript does not allow you to use an `unknown` value until you perform [[TypeScript#Type checking|type checks]] to narrow down what specific type the `unknown` value is. For this reason, `unknown` is considered the type-safe version of `any`.\n```typescript\nconst a: unknown = 30;\nif (typeof a === 'number') {\n\tconst b: number = a + 1; // Now that we are certain `a` is a number, we can use it as one.\n} else {\n\tconst b: number = a + 1; // Error.\n}\n```\n```typescript\nconst a: any = \"Hello\";\nconst b: unknown = \"World\";\n\na.toLowerCase();   // This is fine since `a` is `any`.\nb.toLowerCase();   // Error. We need a type check before \n```\n\u003e A useful way to think about `any` and `unknown` is: `any` means \"I don't care\", `unknown` means \"I don't know (yet)\". \n\n### Object Shape\nAn important part of using TypeScript effectively is in defining the *shape* of object values, or in other words, what properties they have and which ones must be assigned a value or are optional.\n```typescript\n// Let typescript infer the object shape.\n// `person` will be of type: { age: number, name: string }.\nconst person = {\n\tage: 42,\n\tname: \"Andrew\"\n};\n\n// You can also explicitly specify the object type. You might do this if you want to set narrower types for the properties.\nconst person: { age: number, name: \"Andrew\" } = {\n\tage: 42,\n\tname: \"Andrew\"\n};\n\n// Or more cleanly, define a type:\ntype Andrew = { age: number, name: \"Andrew\" };\nconst person: Andrew = {...};\n```\n**Note**: the built-in `object` type is the set of all objects, whether it's `{}`, `{hello: \"world\"}`, `[]`, `new Date()`, etc. It's only slightly more restrictive than `any`.\n\n#### Optional Properties\nBy default, all properties are treated as compulsory. To allow an object to not define a property, just postfix the property name with `?`.\n```typescript\ntype Person = {  \n\tfirstName: string;\n\tlastName: string;\t\n\tmiddleName?: string;   // Objects of type `Person` can optionally set the `middleName` property.\n};\n```\n\n#### Immutable Properties\nYou can make properties immutable by prefixing the property name with the `readonly` property. It's like as if you declared a property as `const`, so once it's assigned for the first time, it cannot be reassigned.\n```typescript\ntype Person = {\n\tname: string;\n\treadonly dateOfBirth: string;\n};\n\nconst me: Person = { name: 'Tim', dateOfBirth: '09/03/2001' };\nme.name = 'Andrew';             // This is fine.\nme.dateOfBirth = '01/01/1970';  // Error.\n```\n\n#### Index Signatures\nWhen you want the flexibility for an object to contain more arbitrary properties with a certain key-value pair type, you can use the index signature syntax, `[key: K]: V`, where `key` can be any name you choose.\n```typescript\ntype FruitRatings = {\n\t[fruitName: string]: number;\n};\n\nconst myFruitRatings: FruitRatings = {\n\tapple: 6,\n\tbanana: 7,\n\tcherry: 9\n};\n```\n\n### Arrays\nTo denote a type as an array of items of type `T`, you can do `T[]` or `Array\u003cT\u003e` (they're [exactly the same](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36842158/arraytype-vs-type-in-typescript)). \n```typescript\n// Array type declaration examples.\ntype Names = string[];\ntype People = { name: string; }[];\ntype Values = (string | number)[];\n```\nIn general, try to keep arrays *homogenous*, that is, of a singular type, otherwise you'd have to do type-checking before TypeScript can let you use the items of the array.\n```typescript\n// When arrays are not homogenous, that is, of one type, you'd have to do some type checking to work with its items.\nconst arr: (string | number)[] = [42, \"Hello\"];\n\narr.forEach(item =\u003e {\n\tif (typeof item === 'number') {\n\t\t// You can use `item` as a number after you've type-checked it.\n\t\tconst num = item * 3;\n\t\tconsole.log('Number: ', num);\n\t} else {\n\t\t// `item` must be a string\n\t\tconst s = item + \" world\";\n\t\tconsole.log('String: ', s);\n\t}\n})\n```\n\nArrays are always mutable by default in TypeScript, that is, you can reassign the value at any index and invoke methods that make in-place modifications like `push` or `reverse`. To make them immutable, you would prefix them with the `readonly` modifier.\n```typescript\ntype Names = readonly string[];\nconst radioheadMembers: Names = ['Thom', 'Johnny', 'Colin', 'Phil', 'Ed'];\n\nradioheadMembers[1] = 'Tim';  // Error.\n```\n\n### Tuples\nRemember, tuples are just *fixed-length arrays*. In typescript, we define a tuple by specifying the type of each item like: `[T1, T2, ...]`:\n```typescript\ntype FullName = [string, string, string?];  // You can make items optional in a tuple, just like for objects.\n                                            // Note: this is basically the same as: `[string, string] | [string, string, string]`.\nconst elon: FullName = [\"Elon\", \"Reeve\", \"Musk\"];\nconst jeff: FullName = [\"Jeff\", \"Bezos\"];\n```\nYou can also make use of the [[JavaScript#Rest Operator|rest operator]], `...`, to allow for tuples of arbitrary lengths.\n```typescript\ntype FullName = [string, string, ...string[]];\nconst queenElizabethII = ['Elizabeth', 'Alexandra', 'Mary', 'Windsor'];\n```\n\n**Caveat**: *tuples are not immutable by default*.\nUnlike in other languages like Python, the items of a tuple in TypeScript *can* be mutated, that is, reassigned after definition. To make tuples immutable, you would do the same thing as you would for making arrays immutable: prefix it with the `readonly` modifier.\n```typescript\ntype Coordinate = readonly [number, number];\nconst point: Coordinate = [1, 2];\n\npoint[0] = 3;   // Error.\n```\n\n### Enums\nEnums are data types that have a *fixed set* of constant values. They're a great way to group together a lot of related constants. *Note*: JavaScript doesn't have enums.\n```typescript\nenum Theme {\n\tLight,\n\tDark,\n\tHighContrastLight,\n\tHighContrastDark\n};\n\n// You access the fields of the enum in the same way that you'd access an object.\nconst theme: Theme = Theme.Dark;\n```\nIn the example above, every enum value gets implicitly assigned a counter value starting from 0. It's equivalent to doing the following:\n```typescript\nenum Theme {\n\tLight = 0,\n\tDark = 1,\n\tHighContrastLight = 2,\n\tHighContrastDark = 3\n}\n```\nYou can also map enum keys to string values instead of integers. \n```typescript\nenum Theme {\n\tLight = '#CCCCCC',\n\tDark = '#333333',\n\tHighContrastLight = '#FFFFFF',\n\tHighContrastDark = '#000000',\n}\n```\n\n#### Caveats\nOne annoying issue is that you can freely assign numbers to enum types that are clearly outside the bounds of the enum values.\n```typescript\nenum Theme {\n\tLight,\n\tDark,\n\tHighContrastLight,\n\tHighContrastDark,\n}\nconst theme: Theme = 6; // No complaints from TypeScript.\n```\nIn general, the official docs advise you to avoid enums unless they help significantly with readability. Alternatives to enums include string literals, eg. `type Theme = \"Light\" | \"Dark\" | ...`, or object literals, eg. `const Theme = { Light: \"Light\", Dark: \"Dark\", ... }`\n\n### Type Inference\nYou don't have to always supply an explicit type. Often, there'll be enough context for TypeScript to figure it out without ambiguity. In general, we prefer type inference over explict assigning types to varaibles/parameters/etc. for conciseness.\n```typescript\nlet a: number = 42;   // There is no need to do this. It's clear what type `a` is from the RHS of the assignment.\nlet b = 42;           // Equivalent to above, but it lets typescript assign the type implicitly.\n```\nThis extends to functions as well, meaning that often you won't have to specify the return value.\n\n#### Type Widening/Narrowing [TODO]\nAn important implicit rule in TypeScript is that when you let type inference happen for `const` variables, TypeScript will assign it the *narrowest type possible* since it knows that a `const` variable cannot possibly take any other value after its defined.\n```typescript\nlet a = 2;    // `a` is of type `number`.\nconst b = 2;  // `b` is of type `2`, a specific member of `number`.\n```\n\t\n### Type Checking\nAlthough type checking is done for you statically, there are times when you must perform run-time type checks such as when you're fetching external data. In these times, rely on JavaScript's operators: `typeof` and `instanceof`.\n1. Use the `instanceof` binary operator to check some value is of a custom type, or a complex built-in type like `RegExp`.\n\t- Note that `val instanceof T` works by checking if `T` exists anywhere along `val`'s [[JavaScript#Prototypes|prototype chain]]. This is why you get unintuitive results when you use `instanceof` on primitive types. For example, `42 instanceof Number` is `false`, but `new Number(42) instanceof Number` is `true`.\n2.  Use the `typeof` unary operator to check some value is some built-in primitive type such as `undefined`, `number`, `string`, `boolean`, etc.\n\n### Type Assertions [TODO]\nWhen you're confident that some value should be a certain type but TypeScript isn't, you can make a type assertion with the `as` keyword.\n\nYou can also make type assertions by prefixing an expression with `\u003cT\u003e`, eg. `\u003cPerson\u003eperson` which is the same as `person as Person`.\n\n\n## Functions\n**Typing Function Delcarations**\nTo type a function declaration, you just assign types for each parameter it takes in and then specify the return type by postfixing the parameter list with a colon and a type.\n```typescript\n// Typing function parameters and return values.\n// To assign a return type to a function, you postfix the parameter list with a colon and a type.\n\n// Regular functions:\nfunction increment(num: number): number {\n\treturn num + 1;\n}\n\n// Arrow functions:\nconst decrement = (num: number): number =\u003e num - 1;\n```\n**Typing Function Expressions or Arrow Functions**\nWhat if you want to specify the type of a callback rather than a function declaration? You would use the syntax: `(param: Type, ...) =\u003e RetType`. Although the syntax is inspired by arrow functions, it is not actually defining a function.\n```typescript\ntype Greeting = (a: string, b: string) =\u003e void;\n\n// Note that the parameter names above don't need to match that of the assigned\n// callback's parameter names, they're purely for documentation.\nconst callback: Greeting = (name, message) =\u003e {\n\tconsole.log(`Hi, I'm ${name}. ${message}`);\n}\ncallback(\"Linus\", \"F*** you, Nvidia.\");\n```\n\n### Optional \u0026 Default Parameters\nJust like how you can make [[TypeScript#Object Shape|object properties optional]] and [[TypeScript#Tuples|tuple items optional]], you can make function parameters optional by postfixing the parameter name with a `?`. Alternatively, you can set a default value for a parameter by assigning a value directly after the parameter name, which is pretty much the same as making it optional.\n```typescript\n// Optional parameter.\nconst greet = (name: string, message?: string) =\u003e {\n\tconsole.log(`Hi ${name}!`);\n\tif (message) console.log(message);\n}\n\n// Default parameter. Notice that the parameter type can often be inferred from the\n// default value that you supply.\n// You can also choose to explicitly set the type anyway like: \n//   `message: string = \"You rock.\"`\nconst greet = (name: string, message = \"You rock.\") =\u003e {\n\tconsole.log(`Hi ${name}! ${message}`);\n}\n```\n\n### Variadic Functions\nA **variadic function** is just one that takes in an arbitrary number of arguments. The vast majority of functions take in a fixed list of parameters, we call these 'fixed-arity' functions. Normally in JavaScript, defining a variadic function requires you to make use of the implicit [`arguments`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments) array in the function body. In TypeScript, it's way more intuitive and can be done in a type-safe way with the rest operator, `...`.\n```typescript\nconst max = (...nums: number[]): number =\u003e {\n\tif (!nums || nums.length === 0) return -Infinity;\n\treturn nums.reduce((maxSoFar, currNum) =\u003e (maxSoFar \u003e currNum) ? maxSoFar : currNum, -Infinity);\n}\n```\n\n### this\nIn JavaScript, `this` is a nightmare for most programmers to work with because its value is different depending on how it is called. In TypeScript, you can minimise surprises around the value of `this` by assigning a type to it as the first function parameter.\n\nTo illustrate the problem:\n```typescript\ntype Person = { name: string, greet: () =\u003e void };\nconst person: Person = {\n\tname: \"Linus Torvalds\",\n\tgreet: function() {\n\t\tconsole.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}`);\n\t}\n}\nperson.greet(); // This works as expected since `this` is bound to `person`.\n\nconst greet = person.greet;\ngreet();        // This fails since the `this` is lost and is no longer bound to `person`.\n```\nThe 'solution' is to assign a type for `this` so that the developer is warned when `this` takes on the wrong type when they invoke a function that uses it.\n```typescript\ntype Person = { name: string, greet: (this: Person) =\u003e void };\nconst person: Person = {\n\tname: \"Linus Torvalds\",\n\tgreet: function(this: Person) {\n\t\tconsole.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}`);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Generators\nSee [[Generators|generators]]. In JavaScript, you can create a [[JavaScript#Generators|generator function]] by postfixing `function` with an asterisk, `*`. *Note*: you cannot define arrow functions as generator functions (at least as of 2022's ES standard).\n```typescript\nfunction* fooGenerator() {\n\tyield 42;\n\tyield 24;\n}\n\nconst fooNums = fooGenerator();\nconsole.log(fooNums.next());    // → { value: 42, done: false }\nconsole.log(fooNums.next());    // → { value: 24, done: false }\nconsole.log(fooNums.next());    // → { value: undefined, done: false }\n\n// You can loop through a generator's values with JavaScript's for-of loops.\nfor (const item of fooGenerator()) {\n    console.log(item);\n}\n```\nTypeScript automatically infers the return type of the generator to be `IterableIterator\u003cnumber\u003e`. To assign an explicit type for what gets yielded, do it the same way that you'd specify the return value, but wrap it around with `IterableIterator`.\n```typescript\nfunction* fooGenerator(): IterableIterator\u003cnumber\u003e {\n\t...\n}\n```\n\n### Iterators\nSee [[Iterators|iterators]]. In JavaScript, an *iterable* is an object containing the `Symbol.iterator` property with the value being a function that returns an *iterator* (which can be done by defining Symbol.iterator to be a [[TypeScript#Generators|generator function]], which always returns an iterator). An *iterator* is an object that defines a `next` method which returns an object of shape: `{ value: any, done: boolean }`.\n\nAn object can be both an *iterable* and an *iterator* at the same time. When you invoke a generator function, for example, you get an object \nof type `IterableIterator` which is both, meaning it has a `Symbol.iterator` property, whose value is a function that returns an iterator, and the `next` method.\n```typescript\nconst favouriteNums = {\n\t*[Symbol.iterator]() {\n\t\tyield 42;\n\t\tyield 2;\n\t\tyield 4;\n\t}\n}\n\nfor (const item of favouriteNums) {\n\tconsole.log(item);\n}\n```\n**Note**: the syntax for defining `Symbol.iterator` as a generator function might seem strange. See this post for clarifications. As for the square brackets around `Symbol.iterator`, it's called the [computed property name syntax](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32515598/square-brackets-javascript-object-key), introduced in ES6.\n\n### Function Overloading\nYou can define a function type that actually consists of multiple function signatures. See the [Function Overloads](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#function-overloads).\n","lastmodified":"2022-07-10T06:12:39.697821947Z","tags":null}}
