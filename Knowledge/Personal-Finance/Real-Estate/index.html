It is a popular investment vehicle in markets where land and building prices increase over time.</p><p>Arguments for and against real estate investing:</p><ul><li>You can borrow to finance the asset, meaning you can <strong>leverage</strong> a huge amount. It&rsquo;s not possible to leverage to the same extent for other investments like shares.</li><li><strong>Transactions costs are huge, &lsquo;forcing&rsquo; you to buy and hold for several years (7+)</strong>. Any capital gains may be nullified by the transactions costs. Expect a total transaction cost of around 10% the purchase price of the property (stamp duty, real estate agent commissions, etc.)</li><li><strong>Illiquid</strong>. You can&rsquo;t pull money out of your investments like for shares. This is sometimes argued as a strength because it keeps investors committed to buying and holding.</li><li>You have <strong>finer control</strong> over the investment compared to shares. With shares, you cannot determine how businesses operate. With real estate, you can make improvements (<em>sweat equity</em>) and negotiate for below-market prices.</li><li>Quality investments usually require <strong>far greater starting sums</strong>. You&rsquo;d need several thousands of dollars to get started in real estate investing, which definitely isn&rsquo;t the case for shares.</li><li>Requires <strong>far more of your time and energy</strong> compared to passively investing in shares. Some time sinks include:<ul><li>Finding professionals to work with.</li><li>Being a landlord.</li><li>Researching suburbs and zoning.</li></ul></li><li>You will be living with day-to-day <strong>emotional challenges and toil</strong> of being a investment property owner. <strong>You should be interested in real estate</strong>. If you have too many work/family obligations or want to channel your time/energy into starting a business, reconsider real estate as an investment. Some headaches include:<ul><li>Tenants causing problems.</li><li>Building maintenance.</li><li>Frustration dealing with real estate agents.</li></ul></li><li>Tax incentives for investors:<ul><li>Negative gearing. Unlike other countries, Australia&rsquo;s tax system lets you make unlimited deductions for income losses on investment properties.<ul><li>If, according to the accounting, your property lost $20000 for this year, and your income was $100000, then you&rsquo;re only taxed on $80000.</li></ul></li><li>Property expenses are tax deductible:<ul><li>Interest on mortgage.</li><li>Building depreciation.</li></ul></li><li>Capital gains tax reductions.<ul><li>50% discount on CGT when you&rsquo;ve held the property for over a year (which makes the vast majority of real estate investors eligible).</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href=#investing-strategy><h2 id=investing-strategy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Investing Strategy</h2></a><p><em>Note</em>: <strong><em>your</em> home (principal place of residence) is not an investment property</strong>. Despite this, home equity is considered a source of security for banks when they&rsquo;re approving further loans.</p><p>As a new investor:</p><ul><li>Diversification wisdom applies equally to real estate investing. Don&rsquo;t concentration your investments on one geographical location. For new investors, <strong>buy away from an area where you live</strong>, such as a different suburb.</li><li>Prefer freestanding houses over other dwelling types. It&rsquo;s harder to achieve positive cash flow, but the expected returns is higher because of the land you hold.</li><li>Consider buying an investment property, but living with your parents.</li></ul><p>Some strategies:</p><ul><li><strong>Serial home selling</strong> is a strategy where you acquire one house, move into it immediately, renovate it, sell it for no CGT, then repeat.</li><li><em>Buying in the path of progress</em> is a (speculative) strategy where you buy undeveloped land in a place where development progress is likely. It depends on you being able to identify places with expected rapid population and job growth.</li><li><em>Buy-and-flip</em> is a strategy where you buy a house at a bargain, optionally fix it up, then sell it at market value very soon after. It&rsquo;s said that opportunities for this have largely disappeared after the GFC.</li></ul><a href=#interest-rate><h2 id=interest-rate><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Interest Rate</h2></a><p>A higher interest rate decreases the <em>purchasing power</em> of buyers, reducing demand and therefore also bringing down house prices.</p><ul><li>Generally, a higher interest rate makes it harder for <em>both</em> home buyers and sellers. Overall, there will be fewer property transactions.</li><li>Buyers can no longer qualify for bigger mortgages unless their wages increase.</li><li>A higher interest rate can <em>sometimes</em> improve rental yield since fewer people can qualify for mortgages.</li></ul><p><strong>You can be prompted to buy a new home by either lower interest rates, or lower housing prices (or both).</strong></p><a href=#gearing><h2 id=gearing><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Gearing</h2></a><p><em><strong>Positive</strong> gearing</em> is where you take a loan to invest, but the income from the investment <em>exceeds</em> your loan&rsquo;s repayments, ie. you&rsquo;re getting a positive net income despite the loan repayments.</p><ul><li>For <em>positively geared investments</em>, you have to pay tax on your rental income.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Negative</strong> gearing</em> is when you take a loan to invest, but the income from that investment is still lower than the loan repayment.</p><ul><li>For <em>negatively geared investments</em>, you can claim a tax deduction on the loss, which is better enjoyed by high income earners. This is a favourable tax policy for investors that also exists in some other countries such as Japan and New Zealand.</li></ul><a href=#dwelling-categories><h2 id=dwelling-categories><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Dwelling Categories</h2></a><p>Dwelling definitions matter legally and will differ between different states/countries.</p><ul><li><strong>Freestanding House</strong> â€” single, <em>detached</em> dwellings which may also have a granny flat on the lot.<ul><li>Most expensive type of dwelling (in terms of purchase and ongoing fees like maintenance and land tax).</li><li>Land value might constitute a huge share of the property&rsquo;s value (e.g. 70%).</li></ul></li><li>Apartment/Flat â€” Land value constitutes a small share of the property&rsquo;s value (e.g. 10%).<ul><li>Buying an apartment only makes you an owner of the &ldquo;airspace&rdquo; and &ldquo;interior surfaces&rdquo; of the unit. The commons areas belong to the body corporate.</li></ul></li><li>Studio â€”</li><li>Terrace â€”</li><li>Townhouse â€” , considered an in-between of apartments and freestanding houses.</li><li>Condominium â€”</li><li>Semi â€”</li><li>Duplex â€”</li><li>Bungalows â€”</li><li>Mansion â€”</li><li>Villas â€”</li></ul><p><strong>Detached dwellings such as freestanding houses tend to perform better than attached dwellings</strong> like apartments in the long term.</p><ul><li>Most people prefer detached dwellings for privacy and more land.</li><li>Detached dwellings are easier to build and therefore oversupply.</li><li>Greater land means higher expected capital growth.</li></ul><p>Detached dwellings tend to have lower rental yields than attached dwellings, however.</p><a href=#expenses><h2 id=expenses><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Expenses</h2></a><p>The main expenses to consider are:</p><ul><li>Property maintenance.</li><li>Strata fee.</li><li>Land tax (which exists mainly for investment properties).<ul><li>The value of the land itself is taxed, not including the property&rsquo;s value.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#tax><h2 id=tax><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Tax</h2></a><a href=#ownership-structure><h3 id=ownership-structure><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Ownership Structure</h3></a><p>Make sure to get property ownership structure right before signing the contract of sale. Claiming the property under your name may lead to more taxes being paid than claiming the property under a different ownership structure (e.g. jointly).</p><ul><li><strong>Sole ownership</strong>: cheapest and simplest. You, and you alone, can decide what to do with the property.<ul><li>Making the spouse that does not work the sole owner of a positively geared property is probably better.</li><li>Making the higher earning spouse the sole owner of a negatively geared property is probably better due to larger tax deductions.<ul><li>If you own multiple IPs, keep in mind that the stacking of tax deductions may push you below your spouse&rsquo;s tax bracket, at which point it&rsquo;d be better to exploit their higher tax bracket for deductions.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Joint tenancy</strong>: held by more than 1 individual, split evenly. The share of ownership due to death of any individual will be distributed to the remaining individuals.<ul><li>This tends to be best for similarly-earning couples.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Tenants-in-common</strong>: held by more than 1 individual, split according to defined proportions (unlike joint tenancy).<ul><li>Allows people to pool together money to afford expensive homes.</li><li>You&rsquo;re vulnerable to the mistakes of other owners. E.g. if one goes bankrupt, then you could be forced to have the property sold.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Partnerships</strong>: held by more than 1 individual indirectly through a <em>partnership</em>.<ul><li>Partners usually have <em>unlimited liability</em>, meaning you can be screwed by the decisions of another partner.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Company</strong>: held by a company.<ul><li>Has limited liability, meaning you don&rsquo;t get financially destroyed if the company dies.</li><li>This is expensive due to fees necessary to ensure compliance to regulation.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#ppor-and-ips><h3 id=ppor-and-ips><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>PPoR and IPs</h3></a><p>PPoRs and IPs have very different tax treatments.</p><ul><li>PPoRs are completely free of CGT.<ul><li>TODO: you can&rsquo;t carelessly exploit this because you must actually live in the PPoR for a while. The ATO does not specify how long precisely, but you must be able to prove that you lived there by receiving utility bills in your name, and having it be where mail is directed.</li></ul></li><li>Costs in maintenance, improvement, mortgage interest, etc. are tax-deductible for IPs, not PPoRs. For investors with a high marginal tax rate (e.g. 45%), the tax deductions are amazing.</li><li>TODO: you can hold a property as a PPoR for up to 6 years before you incur CGT, even if that property is tenanted. This works, provided you don&rsquo;t claim another home as a PPoR.</li></ul><p><strong>Converting a PPoR to an IP</strong>:</p><ul><li>You&rsquo;ll pay CGT on any capital gains from the date of conversion onwards.</li><li>You may be able to claim tax deductions on improvements you made, <em>while it was a PPoR</em>. Things that weren&rsquo;t tax-deductible or depreciable may now be otherwise.<ul><li>This is why you should keep records in the event you convert your PPoR into an IP.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#gearing-1><h2 id=gearing-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Gearing</h2></a><ul><li>Depreciation of wear-and-tearable things like the carpet, oven, blinds, etc. count as expenses and should be claimed to reduce your tax. Many of these things can&rsquo;t be claimed as a one-off tax deduction. These items have different lifespans (which may be entirely inaccurate but we must follow the ATO&rsquo;s guidelines):<ul><li>Carpets depreciate to $0 over 10 years.</li><li>Buildings depreciate to $0 over 40 years.<ul><li><strong>Depreciation affects the costs basis</strong> and therefore has tax impacts you should know about. If you depreciate a building&rsquo;s cost, which costs $100k let&rsquo;s say, for 1 year (for example), and then sell the property at $200k, your capital gain would actually be $102.5k, not $100k.</li></ul></li><li>Capital works (such as driveways) depreciate at the same rate as buildings.</li><li>&mldr; and so on. These lifespans are subject to change by the ATO.</li></ul></li><li>Negative gearing is suited for a higher marginal tax rate individuals. Positive gearing is suited for lower marginal tax rate individuals.</li><li>Currently, there are no limits to how far you can negatively gear. You can even negatively gear to the point of having a negative taxable income (at which point, you owe no taxes and clearly don&rsquo;t benefit from deductions anymore).</li></ul><a href=#zoning><h2 id=zoning><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Zoning</h2></a><blockquote><p>The value of land is heavily dependent upon what you can develop on it. <strong>Never purchase land without thoroughly understanding its zoning status and what you can and can&rsquo;t build on it</strong>.</p></blockquote><a href=#private-treaty-vs-auction><h2 id=private-treaty-vs-auction><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Private Treaty vs. Auction</h2></a><p>There are mainly 2 ways a residential property is sold:</p><ol><li><em>Private treaty</em>: multiple anonymous offers are collected. The best one wins.<ul><li>Anonymity is legally protected.</li><li>These &lsquo;final&rsquo; offers are still conditional (if negotiated) on the house passing building and pest inspection and formal approval from the bank.</li></ul></li><li><em>Auction</em>: multiple people compete and announce their offers. The best one wins.<ul><li>Hiring a buyer&rsquo;s advocate is recommended to keep you in check.</li><li>If there are too few or no bidders, then the auction reverts to a private treaty.</li><li>Auctions can sometime produce inflated prices when two emotional bidders participate in the auction.</li><li>Agents may still try to get bids post-auction from the people who gave up during the actual auction, and push the winner&rsquo;s offer up even further.</li><li>Auctions have an associated <em>reserve price</em>, which is the lowest possible price the seller is willing to sell for.
